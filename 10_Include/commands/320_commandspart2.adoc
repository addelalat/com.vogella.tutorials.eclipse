menu. Add a extension

extension point and select

correct spelled,
otherwise your menu will not be shown.

This should result in a `plugin.xml` file which looks like
the
following.
	
[source,xml]
----
include::res/commands/pluginfileexit.xml[]
----
	
Run the example. You should see menu with the file and if you
select the "Exit" entry you application should exit.
