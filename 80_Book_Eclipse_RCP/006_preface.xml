		<title>Prerequisites</title>
		<para>
			This book requires a working knowledge of Java and assumes that
			you
			are familiar in using the
			Eclipse IDE for
			standard Java
			development.
			It
			assumes no previous
			experience of
			Eclipse
			plug-in and
			Eclipse RCP
			development.
		</para>

		<para> In case you picked this book to learn about Java and
			development with Eclipse, you should start with a different
			reference
			first. 	If
					you don't have
					experience with using the Eclipse IDE for Java
					development, you may want
					to read the
					<ulink url="http://www.vogella.com/books/eclipseide.html">Eclipse IDE book</ulink>

			next line must
			continue at the position of
			<wordasword>[CONTINUE...]</wordasword>
			.
