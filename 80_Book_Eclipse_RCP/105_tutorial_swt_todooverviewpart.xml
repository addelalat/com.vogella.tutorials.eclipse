== Exercise: Build a first SWT UI

	<section>
=== TodoOverviewPart
		
			Add a
			button
			to your
			`TodoOverviewPart`
			class. Besides the button add a
			label
			with the default text set to:
			"Data not available."
		
		
			Attach a
			`SelectionListener`
			to the
			button. If the button
			is pressed, read the number of Todos from
			your
			`ITodoService`
			service and assign the number to
			the text of the label.
		
		
			The following code may serve as an entry point. See
			<<swtuserinterface_solution" />
			for the complete example coding.
		
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/snippets/btn.java[]
----
		
		
			The resulting user interface should look similar to the
			following
			screenshot.
		
		
			<mediaobject>
				<imageobject>
					<!-- TODO: old screenshot, space between items:9 missing -->
					<imagedata fileref="images/todo-overview-first.png"
						scale="60[,pdfwidth=60%]
		
	




=== Example code for TodoOverviewPart
		
			Your resulting implementation of
			`TodoOverviewPart`
			should be similar to the following classes.
