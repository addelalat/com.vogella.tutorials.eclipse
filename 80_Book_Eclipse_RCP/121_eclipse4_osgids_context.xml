== OSGi services and Eclipse dependency injection
	
		OSGi services are available for dependency injection in Eclipse
		applications.
		If you define your custom OSGi
		services, you can inject
		them
		into
		your
		model
		objects.
		This removes the need to create singleton or factory implementations
		in your
		application to access data.
	

	
		If a requested key is not found in the Eclipse context hierarchy,
		the
		Eclipse framework
		dynamically queries for a
		fitting
		OSGi
		service in the
		OSGi
		registry.

		For example, if you have an OSGi service declared for the
		`ITodoService`
		interface you can inject it via the following code snippet into a
		field of an Eclipse part.
	
	
		<programlisting language="java">
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="../examples/diosgi/field.java[]

	Alternatively you can inject the service into a method of such a Eclipse part as
		demonstrated in the following
		listings.
	
	
		<programlisting language="java">
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="../examples/diosgi/method.java[]
