	<title>Exercise: Using TableViewer
	<section>
=== Create a JFace TableViewer for the Todo items
		
			In this exercise you create a JFace table in the
			<code>TodoOverviewPart</code>
			class which displays the
			<code>Todo</code>
			items.
		
	
	<section>
=== Add dependencies
		
			Ensure that the
			<code>org.eclipse.jface</code>
			plug-in is available as a dependency to the
			<code>com.example.e4.rcp.todo</code>
			plug-in. You might have added this dependency already in another exercise.
		
	
	<section>
=== Create implementation
		
			Create a JFace table implementation with the
			<code>summary</code>
			and
			<code>description</code>
			fields as table
			columns.
		
		 Your part should still have the "Load Data" button.
			Load the
			data into the
			viewer
			once this button
			is pressed.
		

		You can use the following example code as base for this
			exercise.
		

		
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/viewer/TodoOverviewPart.java" />
			</programlisting>
		



		The result should look similar to the following screenshot.

		<tip>
			The "Load Data" button is later used, once you implement the
				possibility to delete data.
