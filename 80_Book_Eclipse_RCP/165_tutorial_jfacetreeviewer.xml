== Optional exercise: Implementing a tree to view the todos grouped by tags
	<section>
=== Target of this exercise
		
			In this exercise you create a part with displays a tree with the todo items structured by there tags.
		
	
	<section>
=== Add dependencies
		
			Ensure that 
			`org.eclipse.jface`
			and
			`org.eclipse.e4.ui.dialogs`
			plug-in are available as dependency in the
			`com.example.e4.rcp.todo`
			plug-in.  You might have added these dependencies already in another exercise.

=== Create part implementation
		
			Create the following part implementation with the
			`label`
			or
			`summary`
			and
			`description`
			fields as tree
			columns.
			This part should also have a "Load Data" button to load the data into the
			viewer.
		

		You can use the following example code as base for this
			exercise.
		

		
[source,java]
----
include::res/viewer/TagOverviewPart.java[]

		The result should look similar to the following screenshot.

			The "Load Data" button is later used, once you implement the
				possibility to delete data.
