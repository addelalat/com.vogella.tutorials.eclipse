	<title>Optional exercise: Implementing a tree to view the todos grouped by tags
	<section>
=== Target of this exercise
		
			In this exercise you create a part with displays a tree with the todo items structured by there tags.
		
	
	<section>
=== Add dependencies
		
			Ensure that 
			<code>org.eclipse.jface</code>
			and
			<code>org.eclipse.e4.ui.dialogs</code>
			plug-in are available as dependency in the
			<code>com.example.e4.rcp.todo</code>
			plug-in.  You might have added these dependencies already in another exercise.
		
	
	<section>
=== Create part implementation
		
			Create the following part implementation with the
			<code>label</code>
			or
			<code>summary</code>
			and
			<code>description</code>
			fields as tree
			columns.
			This part should also have a "Load Data" button to load the data into the
			viewer.
		

		You can use the following example code as base for this
			exercise.
		

		
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/viewer/TagOverviewPart.java" />
			</programlisting>
		



		The result should look similar to the following screenshot.
