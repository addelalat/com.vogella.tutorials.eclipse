		<title>Implementation</title>

		<para>
			Ensure that the
			<code>org.eclipse.jface</code>
			plug-in is available as a
			dependency to your
			<code>com.example.e4.rcp.todo</code>
			plug-in. If you followed the previous exercises, this should be
			already the
			case.
		</para>

		<para>
			Create a new class called
			<code>TodoDeletionPart</code>
			and a new
			part
			in your application model
			which refers to this new class.
		</para>


		<para>
			Rearrange the user interface so that the left area of your
			application
			contains two
			parts. The
			<code>TodoDeletionPart</code>
			part
			should be below the
			<code>TodoOverviewPart</code>
			part.
		</para>
		<tip>
			<para>If a certain part of your user interface is not displayed,
				check
				the container data of your model elements in the
				application
				model. If
				one of the children of
				a container uses container data, all
				elements
				need to define container data.
			</para>
		</tip>

		<para>
			Implement a
			<code>ComboViewer</code>
			which allows you to select a Todo item. Add a
			button
			to the
			part.
			If this
			button
			is pressed the
			<code>deleteTodo()</code>
			method of your
			<code>ITodoService</code>
			should be called. You can use the following example code as
			reference.
		</para>

		<para>
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/viewer/TodoDeletionPart.java" />
			</programlisting>
		</para>

		<tip>
			<para>
				If you face issues with the selection in the viewer or the
				deletion
				of a
				<code>Todo</code>
				object, ensure that
				<code>equals()</code>
				and
				<code>hashCode()</code>
				methods in
				<code>Todo</code>
				are
				correct (they should be based on the
				<parameter>id</parameter>
				field, see
				<xref linkend="services_todo_tostringhashcode" />
				).
			</para>
		</tip>

	<section>
		<title>Validation</title>
		<para>
			Delete entries in your data model. The
			<code>ComboViewer</code>
			should be updated automatically.
		</para>
		<para>
			Validate that the number of entries in your data model has been
			reduced, e.g., by pressing the
			<guibutton>Load Data</guibutton>
			button
			in the
			<code>TodoOverviewPart</code>
			part.
