== Optional exercise: Using ComboViewer
	<section>
=== Target
		
			In this exercise you create a new
			part
			which allows you to delete a
			`Todo`
			object from your model based on the selection in your
			`ComboViewer`
			. The final
			part
			should look similar to the following.

	<section>
=== Implementation

		
			Ensure that the
			`org.eclipse.jface`
			plug-in is available as a
			dependency to your
			`com.example.e4.rcp.todo`
			plug-in. If you followed the previous exercises, this should be
			already the
			case.
		

		
			Create a new class called
			`TodoDeletionPart`
			and a new
			part
			in your application model
			which refers to this new class.
		


		
			Rearrange the user interface so that the left area of your
			application
			contains two
			parts. The
			`TodoDeletionPart`
			part
			should be below the
			`TodoOverviewPart`
			part.
		
		TIP:
			If a certain part of your user interface is not displayed,
				check
				the container data of your model elements in the
				application
				model. If
				one of the children of
				a container uses container data, all
				elements
				need to define container data.
			
		</tip>

		
			Implement a
			`ComboViewer`
			which allows you to select a Todo item. Add a
			button
			to the
			part.
			If this
			button
			is pressed the
			`deleteTodo()`
			method of your
			`ITodoService`
			should be called. You can use the following example code as
			reference.
		

		
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/viewer/TodoDeletionPart.java[]
----
		

		TIP:
			
				If you face issues with the selection in the viewer or the
				deletion
				of a
				`Todo`
				object, ensure that
				`equals()`
				and
				`hashCode()`
				methods in
				`Todo`
				are
				correct (they should be based on the
				_id_
				field, see
				<xref linkend="services_todo_tostringhashcode" />
				).
			
		</tip>
	
	<section>
=== Validation
		
			Delete entries in your data model. The
			`ComboViewer`
			should be updated automatically.
		
		
			Validate that the number of entries in your data model has been
			reduced, e.g., by pressing the
			_Load Data_
			button
			in the
			`TodoOverviewPart`
			part.
