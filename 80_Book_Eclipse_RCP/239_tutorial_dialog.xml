== Confirmation dialog at exit
	
		Ensure that the
		`org.eclipse.jface`
		plug-in is defined as dependency of your application plug-in.
	
	
		In your
		`ExitHandler`
		class ensure that the user wants to exit the application via a
		confirmation dialog. This is done in the following code.
	
	
		<programlisting language="java">
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
				parse="text" href="../examples/dialog/ExitHandler.java" />
		</programlisting>
	
	<warning>
		
			A handler is executed in the context in which it is called.
			It should
			receive all its input via its @Execute method.
			Field or
			constructor
			injection
			in a handler does only work for special cases, i.e.
			objects
			provided by an
			`ExtendedObjectSupplier`.
		
	</warning>

	
		Test your implementation. If you select the
		_Cancel_
		button
		on the confirmation dialog the application should not
		terminate.
