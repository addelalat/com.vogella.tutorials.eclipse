== Optional exercise: Dynamic creation of parts based on a part descriptor

=== Create a class for the part descriptor

		Create the following new class.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/dynamics/DynamicPart.java[]
----
		
	

=== Create the part descriptor model element
		
			Create a
			part descriptor
			model element
			in your application model using
			the
			_com.example.e4.rcp.todo.partdescriptor.dynamic_
			ID. In the
			_Class URI_
			field point to your new
			`DynamicPart`
			class.

			The
			_Multiple_
			attribute should be flagged.
		
	

=== Create a handler for creating new parts


		
			Add a new handler and a new command for creating a new
			part to
			your application model. The code for
			the
			handler
			class should be
			similar to the following code.
		
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/dynamics/DynamicPartHandler.java[]
----
		
		
			Add a new menu called
			_Dynamic Contributions_
			to your application model.
		
		Also add a new menu entry to your new menu, pointing to your new
			command.
		

		
			Start your application and validate that you can dynamically
			create
			and display
			new
			parts. As you have set the
			_Multiple_
			flag on the part descriptor, you can also open multiple instances of
			the part.
