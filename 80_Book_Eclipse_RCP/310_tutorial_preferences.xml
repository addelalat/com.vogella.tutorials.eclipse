	<title>Exercise: Using preferences in the life cycle class

[[tutorial_preferencesstorage_target">
=== Target
		In this exercise you store the last logged in user name in the
			preferences.
		
		
			You continue to use the dialog which you created in
			<xref linkend="tutorial_passworddialog" />
			.
			In this exercise you modify your life cycle handler
			so
			that the previously
			entered user is displayed again in the
			password
			dialog.
		
	
[[tutorial_preferenceannotation">
=== Dependency
		
			The
			<code>@Preference</code>
			annotation is provided by the
			<code>org.eclipse.e4.core.di.extensions</code>
			plug-in. Ensure that you have entered a dependency to this plug-in in
			the
			<filename>MANIFEST.MF</filename>
			file
			of your application plug-in. If you followed the previous
			exercises correctly this dependency is already entered.
		
	

[[tutorial_preferencesinterface">
=== Create interface for the preference constants
		
			Create the
			<code>com.example.e4.rcp.todo.preferences</code>
			package and the following interface in this package.
		
		
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text"
					href="../examples/preferences/PreferenceConstants.java" />
			</programlisting>
		


	

[[tutorial_preferencesadvanced">

			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="../examples/preferences/Manager.java" />
			</programlisting>
		

	

[[tutorial_preferences_validatelifecycle">
=== Validate life cycle handling
		Start your application and enter a user. Stop and the
			application and start the application again. The login
			dialog should
			display the last
			entered user.
		
		<tip>
			If persisting the user does not work, you potentially have an
				incorrect setting in your launch configuration.
			
			
				Ensure that the
				_Clear_
				flag in the
				menu:
					<guimenu>Project</guimenu>
					<guisubmenu>Run Configurations...</guisubmenu>
				</menuchoice>
				is not set. Otherwise your preference data
				is deleted during the
				start of the application.
