== Exercise: Data binding for table viewers

=== Implement data binding for the table viewer
		
			Change your implementation of
			`TodoOverviewPart`
			to use data binding.
		
		
			For this you can delete the
			`LabelProvider`
			of your
			`TableViewerColumn`
			objects. Also remove the
			`viewer.setInput()`
			and the
			`ContentProvider`
			.
		
		The following code demonstrates this implementation.
		
		<tip>
			
				The following code
				snippet only contains the data binding
				relevant part of the code. If you did any of the optional exercises
				your
				implementation
				may
				also
				include a search
				box, the registration of
				the
				popup menu, a filter or more.
			
		</tip>
		
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="../examples/databinding/TodoOverviewPart.java" />
			</programlisting>
		
	

=== Clean up old code
		<warning>
			
				You should not have any call to the
				`setInput`
				,
				`setContentProvider`
				and
				`setLabelProvider`
				methods anymore in your code. Use the text search to validate this
				in case you are having problems.
			
		</warning>


	


=== Validating
		
			Start your application and load the data into the table via the
			_Load data_
			button. Ensure that the data is displayed correctly in the table.
		
		<note>
			
				Currently the selection of the table is not sent to the
				TodoDetailsPart. This will be implemented in
				<xref linkend="tutorial_usingeselectionservice" />
				.
			
		</note>
