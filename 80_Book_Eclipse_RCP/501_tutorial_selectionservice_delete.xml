== Optinal exercise: Selection service for deleting data


=== Implement the RemoveTodoHandler handler
		
			Implement
			`RemoveTodoHandler`
			so that the selected
			`Todo`
			is deleted.
		

		
[source,java]
----
include::res/delete/RemoveTodoHandler.java[]
----
		
	

=== Validate that the deletion works

		
			Run your application and select a line in your JFace
			table. Select
			your
			menu:Edit[Remove Todo]
			menu entry.
		
		
			Press the "Load Data" button to update the table. Validate that the
			selected
			`Todo`
			is not available anymore.
		
		NOTE:
			
				Currently your parts are not reacting to changes in your data
				model
				and you have to press the
				_Load Data_
				button in your
				`TodoOverviewPart`
				part.
				You will fix that after you learned about the event bus of
				Eclipse in
				<xref linkend="part_eventbroker" />
				.
			
		

	


=== Test the context menu for deletion
		TIP:
			This exercise is optional
		
		
			In
			<xref linkend="tutorial_commandscontextmenu" />
			you defined a context (popup) menu for your table.
			As the
			`RemoveTodoHandler`
			class is already
			correctly implemented, you should be able to delete
			selected items
			with the
			_Delete_
			context menu without any changes in the
			`RemoveTodoHandler`
			handler class.
		
		
			Delete one todo item. Use the
			_Load Data_
			button and validate that the delete item has been removed from the data model.
