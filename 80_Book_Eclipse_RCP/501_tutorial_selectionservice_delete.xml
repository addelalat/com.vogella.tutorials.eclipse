[[tutorial_usinge4service_5">
=== Implement the RemoveTodoHandler handler
		
			Implement
			<code>RemoveTodoHandler</code>
			so that the selected
			<code>Todo</code>
			is deleted.
		

		
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="../examples/delete/RemoveTodoHandler.java" />
			</programlisting>
		
	
[[tutorial_usinge4service_validate">
=== Validate that the deletion works

		
			Run your application and select a line in your JFace
			table. Select
			your
			menu:Edit[Remove Todo]
			menu entry.
		
		
			Press the "Load Data" button to update the table. Validate that the
			selected
			<code>Todo</code>
			is not available anymore.
		
		<note>
			
				Currently your parts are not reacting to changes in your data
				model
				and you have to press the
				_Load Data_
				button in your
				<code>TodoOverviewPart</code>
				part.
				You will fix that after you learned about the event bus of
				Eclipse in
				<xref linkend="part_eventbroker" />
				.
			
		</note>

	

[[tutorial_usinge4service_6">
=== Test the context menu for deletion
		<tip>
			This exercise is optional
		</tip>
		
			In
			<xref linkend="tutorial_commandscontextmenu" />
			you defined a context (popup) menu for your table.
			As the
			<code>RemoveTodoHandler</code>
			class is already
			correctly implemented, you should be able to delete
			selected items
			with the
			_Delete_
			context menu without any changes in the
			<code>RemoveTodoHandler</code>
			handler class.
		
		
			Delete one todo item. Use the
			_Load Data_
			button and validate that the delete item has been removed from the data model.
