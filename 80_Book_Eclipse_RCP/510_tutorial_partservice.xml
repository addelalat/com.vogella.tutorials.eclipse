== Exercise: Enable handlers and avoiding data loss


=== Enable the save handler only if necessary
		
			Change your
			`SaveAllHandler`
			class so that the
			_save_
			handler is only active if there is a
			part
			in the model which has its
			`dirty`
			attribute set to true.

=== Enable the deletion handler only if necessary
		NOTE:
			This exercise is optional.
		
		
			Similar to
			<<tutorial_usingpartservice_save>>
			enable the deletion handler for todos only if a
			`Todo`
			is selected.
		
	


=== Avoid data loss in your ExitHandler
		
			Change your
			`ExitHandler`
			class so that in the case of a dirty editor the user is prompted
			if he
			wants to save the data.
