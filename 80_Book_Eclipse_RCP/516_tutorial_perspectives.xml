== Exercise: Using multiple perspectives

=== Target of this exercise
		In this exercise you define another perspective and implement a
			menu to switch between your perspectives.
		
	


=== Create a new perspective

		
			Define a new perspective called
			_Manager_
			in your application. You should know by
			now how to do this, therefore it is not described in this exercise.
			Ensure that
			your new perspective has at least one
			part in it
			(contained in a PartStack so that the part label is
			visible).
		
		WARNING:
			Ensure to add the perspective to the existing
				PerspectiveStack.
			
		
	

=== Create new menu entries
		Create a command and a handler to switch between perspectives.
			The handler class for switching perspectives
			might
			look
			like
			the
			following.
		
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/perspectives/PerspectiveSwitchHandler.java[]
----
		
		
			Create or update a
			_Windows_
			menu entry in your menu main with a sub-menu called
			_Switch Perspective_
			.

		


		
			Add a new menu
			entry in your application model to switch
			between
			your
			perspectives.

		Test if you can switch between your perspectives with your new
			handler.
		

	

=== Using command parameters to define the perspective ID
		TIP:
			This exercise is optional
		

		
			Currently your perspective switcher only allows to switch
			between two
			perspectives. Use parameters in your command and
			menu
			entries to
			specify to which perspective you want to switch. See
			<<commands_parameter>>
			for an example how to do this.
