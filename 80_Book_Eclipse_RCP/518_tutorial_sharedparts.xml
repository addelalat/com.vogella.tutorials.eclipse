	<title>Exercise: Sharing elements between perspectives

[[tutorial_using_placeholder_target">
=== Target
		
			This tutorial demonstrates how you can share parts between
			perspectives. You created already an perspective in
			<xref linkend="tutorial_using_perspectives" />
			, this is reused in this exercise.

=== Using shared parts between perspectives
		
			Using the
			_Placeholder_
			model element you are able to define elements which should be shared
			between
			perspectives. In this exercise you define
			a shared part which
			is
			displayed in both perspectives.
		
		
			Add a
			part
			as
			_Shared Elements_
			to your application model.

			Add a
			_Placeholder_
			entry to both perspectives into a stack. Point to
			the
			_Shared Elements_
			part in this placeholder.

		As result you should have two placeholders pointing to the
			shared
			element.

			If you switch between your perspectives, this
			part
			should be the
			same.
		
		<tip>
			By using this approach the part displayed in two perspectives
				is
				the same instance, i.e. the data in the part is
				the same. If you
				define two parts using the same
				class reference, the
				Eclipse runtime
				creates two instances
				(objects).
