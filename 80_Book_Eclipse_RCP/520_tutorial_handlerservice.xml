== Optional exercise: Using handler service

=== Enable save in the EditorPart
		Allow the user to save in the EditorPart directly. Reuse the save all command.

		
[source,java]
----
include::res/editor/EditorPartSave.java[]
----
		
		NOTE:
			You could also specify a parameter for your command with the id of the todo item should be saved and pass that
				as value for the parameter in the handler.
			
		</note>


	

=== Delete Todos only via the handler
		
			Change your
			`TodoDeletionPart`
			class so that it uses the
			`EHandlerService`
			to trigger the existing deletion handler to delete the selected
			`Todo`
			from the
			`ComboViewer`
			.
		
		
			Add the following dependencies to your application plug-in:
			<itemizedlist>
				*
					
						`org.eclipse.e4.core.commands`
					
				
				*
					
						`org.eclipse.e4.core.contexts`
					
				
			

		
	


=== Implementation
		
			Change your
			`TodoDeletionPart`
			based on the following example code.

		

		
[source,java]
----
include::res/handler/TodoDeletionPart.java[]
----
		

		NOTE:
			
				The handler and command service have not been
				released as official API. See
				<xref linkend="e4overview_api" />
				.
