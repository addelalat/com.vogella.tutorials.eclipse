== Optional Exercise: Model add-on to change the close behavior of the IDE

=== Target
		
			In this exercise you register an existing model add-on created in
			<<exercise_modeladdonclose" />
			with the Eclipse IDE.
			This is done similar to the approach described in
			<<firstplugin_migratione4" />
			, the only difference is that you contribute a model add-on.
		
	


=== Register model add-on via model fragment with the Eclipse IDE

			the IDE with a dirty editor.
