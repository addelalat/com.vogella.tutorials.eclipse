== Optional Exercise: Make toolbar visible dependent on the perspective

=== Target of this exercise
		
			In this exercise you develop a model add-on which allows to define that a toolbar is only visible 
			in a certain perspective. If no tag is set, it is always visible. If a tag is set, it must identify 
			the perspectives for which it is valid via model tags.
		
	


=== Creating a new class for the model add-on
		Create the following new class for the model add-on.
		
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/addon/ToolbarsVisiblePerPerspectiveAddon.java[]
----
		

	

=== Registering your add-on with the application model
		In your application model add a new model add-on with a reference to the new class. 
	

=== Tagging a toolbar
		In your application model tag at least one of your toolbars with the prefix "perspective:" followed by the ID of
			one of your perspectives.
		
	

=== Verifying the model add-on
		Start your application. Verify that the toolbar tagged for a certain perspective is only visible if you have
			selected the corresponding perspective.
