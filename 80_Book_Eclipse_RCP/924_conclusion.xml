	<para>I hope you enjoyed your learning experience with the Eclipse RCP framework.
	</para>
	<para> The Eclipse platform provides a modern, flexible and
		powerful programming model. Building
		your
		application based on
		this framework enables you
		to leverage these
		capabilities and to create
		powerful native
		applications.
	</para>
	<para>
		The Eclipse platform is also under active development. With developers from Google, Redhat, IBM and smaller
		companies and individuals the frameworks gets extended and improved in every release.
	</para>
	<para>
		The development
		team
		is also open for
		feedback and code contributions, so you can help to enhance the framework in a
		direction you find important.
	</para>
	<para>
		Please use the Eclipse
		Forum or the
		Eclipse bug
		tracker
		to
		provide
		feedback and bug
		reports and the Eclipse Gerrit code
		review
		system to provide code contributions.
	</para>
	<para>I am personally very impressed by the ability of our Eclipse
		development community in providing this level of code
		stability combined with this level of innovation. I believe this
		ability and the existing ecosystem will ensure that
		the Eclipse
		programming model will remain one
		of the strongest programming models
		for creating native clients.
