== Closing words
	I hope you enjoyed your learning experience with the Eclipse RCP framework.
	
	 The Eclipse platform provides a modern, flexible and
		powerful programming model. Building
		your
		application based on
		this framework enables you
		to leverage these
		capabilities and to create
		powerful native
		applications.
	
	
		The Eclipse platform is also under active development. With developers from Google, Redhat, IBM and smaller
		companies and individuals the frameworks gets extended and improved in every release.
	
	
		The development
		team
		is also open for
		feedback and code contributions, so you can help to enhance the framework in a
		direction you find important.
	
	
		Please use the Eclipse
		Forum or the
		Eclipse bug
		tracker
		to
		provide
		feedback and bug
		reports and the Eclipse Gerrit code
		review
		system to provide code contributions.
	
	I am personally very impressed by the ability of our Eclipse
		development community in providing this level of code
		stability combined with this level of innovation. I believe this
		ability and the existing ecosystem will ensure that
		the Eclipse
		programming model will remain one
		of the strongest programming models
		for creating native clients.
