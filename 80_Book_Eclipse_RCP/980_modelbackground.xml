	<title>Architectural background of the application model
	This section contains some background information about the
		design goals of the Eclipse application model and has been
		contributed by Eric Moffatt, Eclipse 4 SDK development lead.
	
[[modelbackground_areas">
=== Main areas of the model
		
			Conceptually the model
			is structured into three areas which are
			described in the following
			table.
			<table frame='all'>
		=== Architectural areas of the model
				<tgroup cols='2' align='left' colsep='1' rowsep='1'>
					<colspec colname='c1' colwidth="1*" />
					<colspec colname='c2' colwidth="2*" />
					<thead>
						<row>
							<entry>Area</entry>
							<entry>Description</entry>
						</row>
					</thead>
					<tbody>
						<row>
							<entry>Mix-ins</entry>
							<entry>
								Abstract
									interfaces containing the attributes necessary to
									support their
									specific roles in some derived concrete types.
								
								
									For example
									<code>MContext</code>
									contains only the reference to the context,
									<code>MContribution</code>
									contains the instantiated 'object' and
									<code>MUILabel</code>
									contains attributes to manage labels and images.
								
							</entry>
						</row>
						<row>
							<entry>Containment Types</entry>
							<entry>
								Every concrete container specifies a specific interface as
									its containment type. It allows the generic to be a specific
									type
									and the compiler to generate a compile time error if an
									attempt
									is made to add an invalid element to a container.
								
								
									It also means that when creating a domain specific model (or
									changing
									the base model) it is relatively easy to loosen the
									containment
									rules.
									For example to allow
									<code>MParts</code>
									in the
									<code>MTrim</code>
									area, you would only have to add the
									<code>MTrimElement</code>
									interface to
									<code>MPart</code>
									.
								
							</entry>
						</row>

						<row>
							<entry>Concrete Classes</entry>
							<entry>Elements that the application model itself
								contains,
								defined by a combination of various mix-ins and
								containment
								types. These are further sub-divided based into packages in the
								model definition model.
							</entry>
						</row>

[[modelbackground_mixins">
=== Advantages of using mix-ins
		
			_Mix-ins_
			allow the Eclipse 4 internal code to manage the
			mix-ins
			specifically,
			regardless of the concrete class they're a
			part of. For
			example the
			<code>PartRenderingEngine</code>
			class
			handles all contexts by checking whether the element being
			rendered
			is
			an
			<code>MContext</code>
			. It also allows via the
			<code>findElements()</code>
			method of
			<code>EModelService</code>
			to locate all elements in the model of a specific type. This is 
			useful for
			finding all
			<code>MDirtyable</code>
			elements for saving.
		
		
			Mix-ins
			make
			domain specific modeling
			simpler. The Eclipse 4 team
			anticipate
			that more
			sophisticated
			clients
			create domain specific
			models
			(and the
			corresponding
			renderers) so that
			they could work
			directly
			against their
			own element
			types.
		
		
			Having the
			mix-ins
			in place makes this much simpler as well as
			being able to
			reuse
			existing code written to manage a particular
			mix-in.
