			While the Eclipse IDE for Java development is widely known, the
			Eclipse open source
			community is much bigger. Currently
			it consists of more
			than
			150
			projects
			covering
			different aspects
			of
			software development. For
			example,
			Eclipse projects
			provide tooling for JavaScript development
			and runtime components, like
			the
			popular
			<wordasword>Jetty</wordasword>
			webserver.

			The roots of Eclipse go
			back to 2001. The initial code base was
			provided by IBM. In November 2001, a consortium
			was formed to support
			the development of Eclipse as open source software. This consortium
			was controlled by IBM.
		</para>
		<para>
			In 2004 it became the
			<wordasword>Eclipse Foundation</wordasword>
			, which is a vendor neutral foundation where no single company
			has
			control of the direction.
		</para>
		<para>
			The
			<wordasword>Eclipse</wordasword>
			name at this time was viewed by many as declaration of war against
			<wordasword>Sun Microsystems</wordasword>
			, the company responsible for developing the Java
			programming
			language. IBM stated that the name was targeting at
			"Eclipsing"
			Microsoft. See
			<ulink url="http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Application-Development/Eclipse-Behind-the-Name/">Eclipse: Behind the Name</ulink>
			for details.
		</para>
		<para>
			With the purchase of
			<wordasword>Sun Microsystems</wordasword>
			by Oracle this conflict finally went away. Oracle is currently
			among
			the 5 largest contributor companies of the Eclipse
			project.

			The Eclipse open source project has a simultaneous release every
			year. Eclipse projects can choose to join this
			release but must
			fulfill the requirements described in the
			<ulink url="https://wiki.eclipse.org/SimRel/Simultaneous_Release_Requirements">Release requirements wiki</ulink>
			.
		</para>
		<para>

			This simultaneous release includes new versions of the Eclipse
			IDE distributions.
			Before
			2012
			Eclipse was
			released in
			version 3.x, e.g.
			Eclipse 3.6,
			Eclipse 3.7.
			These releases
			and the corresponding API are
			referred to
			as
			Eclipse
			3.x.
		</para>
		<para>
			As of 2012 the main Eclipse release carried the major
			version
			number 4, e.g., Eclipse 4.2 in the year 2012,
			Eclipse 4.3 in
			2013, Eclipse 4.4. in 2014, Eclipse 4.5 in 2015 and Eclipse 4.6 in 2016.
