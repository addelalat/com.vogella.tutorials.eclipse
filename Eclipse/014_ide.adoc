== Different Eclipse IDE distributions

=== The Eclipse IDE for Java development
		
Most people know
Eclipse
as an integrated development
environment
(IDE)
for Java. In 2014 the Eclipse IDE is the
leading
development
environment for Java
with a market share of approximately 65%.
		
The Eclipse IDE can be
extended
with
additional software components.
Eclipse calls these software components
_plug-ins_. Plug-in can be grouped into
_features_.
		
Several 
projects and
companies
have
extended the Eclipse
IDE
or
created stand-alone applications
(Eclipse
Rich Client Platform) on top of the
Eclipse
framework.
		
=== The Eclipse IDE distributions from the Eclipse Packaging Project (EPP)
		
The Eclipse IDE is also available as an IDE for other languages,
ranging
from C, C++ to Lua, Python, Perl and PHP.
Several
pre-packaged
Eclipse distributions are available for download. These pre-packaged solutions are provided by an
Eclipse project called the Eclipse Packaging Project (EPP).
		
=== Developer and milestone downloads
		
The Eclipse project has a simultaneous release every year at the
end of June. In June
2016 the Eclipse 4.6 (Neon)
version was released.
		
The top-level Eclipse
project creates regular builds of the next
releases including JDT, PDT and the Eclipse
platform
projects. This is called the Eclipse SDK.

You
find
_Stable Builds_
which are tested by the community. These
_milestone_
(ending with M and a number) and
_release candidate_
(RC) builds are created based
on a
predefined
time schedule.
_Integration_
(I)
and
_Nightly_
(N)
builds are test builds which are automatically created. They
are
not
manually tested.

In general, milestone and RC
builds are
relative stable compared
to
integration builds, but may not contain the
latest
features and
patches.
		
You find one of latest Eclipse SDK builds under the
http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/ - Eclipse project download page
link.
		
		
The packaged solutions are also available as developer release. You find them by clicking on the
_Developer Builds_
tab from the
https://www.eclipse.org/downloads">Eclipse download page
.
