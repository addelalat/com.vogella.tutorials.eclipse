== Java requirements of the Eclipse IDE
	
The Eclipse Neon (4.6) release requires Java 8 to run.
	
The Eclipse IDE contains its custom Java compiler hence a JRE is sufficient for most tasks with Eclipse.
The _JDK_version of Java is only required if you compile Java source code on the command line and for certain web development tools.
	
Please note that you need a 64 JVM to run a 64 bit Eclipse and a 32 bit JVM to run a 32 bit Eclipse.
