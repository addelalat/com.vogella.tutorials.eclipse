	<para>
		The Eclipse IDE contains its custom Java compiler hence a JRE is
		sufficient for most tasks with Eclipse.
		The
		<wordasword>JDK</wordasword>
		version of Java is only
		required if you compile Java source code
		on the
		command line
		and
		for
		advanced
		development scenarios.
		For example, if you
		use
		automatic
		builds or if
		you develop Java web
		applications.

	<para>Please note that you need a 64 JVM to run a 64 bit Eclipse and a
		32 bit JVM to run a 32 bit Eclipse.
