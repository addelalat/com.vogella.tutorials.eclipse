== Installation the Eclipse IDE

=== Java requirements of the Eclipse IDE
	
The Eclipse Neon (4.6) release requires Java 8 to run.

[NOTE]
====    
Please note that you need a 64 JVM to run a 64 bit Eclipse and a 32 bit JVM to run a 32 bit Eclipse.
====    

	
The Eclipse IDE contains its custom Java compiler hence a JRE is sufficient for most tasks with Eclipse.
The _JDK_ version of Java is only required if you compile Java source code on the command line and for advanced development scenarios.
For example, if you use automatic builds or if you develop Java web applications.

=== Install the Eclipse IDE

After you downloaded the file with the Eclipse distribution, unpack it to a local directory.
Most operating systems can
extract
zip or tar.gz
files in their file
browser
(e.g.,
_Windows 7_)
with a right-click
on the file and selecting
"Extract all...".

NOTE: As a developer person you probably know how to extract a compressed file but if in doubt,
search with
Google for "How
to extract a
zip (or tar.gz on Linux and Mac OS) file on ...",
replacing
"..." with
your operating system.

Extract Eclipse into a directory with no spaces in its path, and do not use mapped network drives. Also
avoid to
have path names longer than 255 characters. Installations of Eclipse in directories with long path names
might cause
problems, as some Microsoft Windows tooling can not manage these long path names.

After you extracted the compressed file you can start Eclipse, no
additional
installation procedure is
required.

=== What to do if the Eclipse IDE does not start

A common startup error happens when the user tries to launch a 64-bit version of Eclipse using a 32 bit JVM or vice versa. 
In this case Eclipse does not start and the user gets a message containing *exit code=13*. 
This happens when the version of Eclipse is not matching the JVM version. 
A 32-bit Eclipse must run with Java 32 bit, and 64-bit Eclipse must use a 64-bit JVM.

Use

[source, console]
----
java -version
----

on the command line. 
If the output does contain the word "Server" you are using the 64 bit version of Java and must use a 64 bit version of Eclipse.
If it does not contain "Server", you have to use the 32 bit version of Eclipse.

=== Starting the Eclipse IDE
        
To start Eclipse, double-click the `eclipse.exe` (Microsoft Windows) or `eclipse` (Linux / Mac) file in the directory where you unpacked Eclipse.
        
The Eclipse system prompts you for a _workspace_.
The _workspace_ is the location in your file system where Eclipse stores its preferences and other resources. 
For example, your projects can be stored in the workspace.
        
Select an empty directory and click the btn:[OK] button.

Eclipse starts and shows the _Welcome_ page.
Close this page by clicking the _x_ beside _Welcome_.

After closing the welcome screen, the application should look similar to the following screenshot.

=== Appearance

The appearance of Eclipse can be configured. 
By default, Eclipse ships with a few themes but you can also extend Eclipse with new themes.
        
To change the appearance, select from the menu menu:Window[Preferences > General > Appearance].
        
The _Theme_ selection allows you to change the appearance of your Eclipse IDE.
For example you can switch to the _Dark_ theme of Eclipse.
