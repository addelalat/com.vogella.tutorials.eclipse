			After you downloaded the
			file with the Eclipse distribution, unpack it
			to a local
			directory.
			Most operating systems can
			extract
			zip or tar.gz
			files in their file
			browser
			(e.g.,
			<wordasword>Windows 7</wordasword>
			)
			with a right-click
			on the file and selecting
			"Extract all...".

				As a developer person you probably know how to extract a
				compressed
				file but
				if in
				doubt,
				search with
				Google for "How
				to extract a
				zip (or tar.gz on Linux and Mac OS) file on ...",
				replacing
				"..." with
				your operating system.

			Extract Eclipse into a directory with no spaces in its path, and do not use mapped network drives. Also
			avoid to
			have path names longer than 255 characters. Installations of Eclipse in directories with long path names
			might cause
			problems, as some Microsoft Windows tooling can not manage these long path names.
		</para>

		<para>
			After you extracted the compressed file you can start Eclipse, no
			additional
			installation procedure is
			required.

		<title>Solving exit code=13 while starting the Eclipse IDE</title>
		<para>
			A common startup error happens when the user tries to launch a 64-bit version of Eclipse using a 32 bit JVM or vice
			versa. In this
			case Eclipse does not start and the user gets a message containing exit code=13. This happens when the
			version of
			Eclipse is not
			matching the JVM version. A 32-bit Eclipse must run with Java 32 bit, and 64-bit Eclipse must
			use a
			64-bit JVM.
			Use
			<code>java -version</code>
			on the command line and if the output does not contain the word "Server" you are using the 32 bit version of Java and
			must use a 32 bit version of Eclipse.
