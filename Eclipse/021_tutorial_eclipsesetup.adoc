== Exercise: IDE preference settings

=== Configuration
		
Certain settings in the Eclipse IDE allow you to use it more
efficiently. In this exercise you make changes to the default Eclipse
IDE
settings to improve the usability of the Eclipse IDE.
		
TIP: Feel free to disagree with these recommendations. There is not a single correct setting for everyone in the world.

=== Link Java editor with the Package Explorer view
		
You can synchronize the currently selected
Java editor with the
selection in the
_Package Explorer_
view. This gives you a clearer visibility which object you are
currently
editing.
		
Enable this by selecting the corresponding button in the
_Package Explorer_
view.

=== Java editor settings
		
Open the Eclipse preferences with the
menu:Window[Preferences]
menu.
		
Ensure that Eclipse places the semicolon and the braces automatically
at the right
position. Use the search box in the preferences to find
this setting.
A good search term is
_semicolon_
as depicted in the following screenshot.

=== Use Type Filters

NOTE: The following setting assumes that you don't use classes from the AWT
or
Swing user interface toolkit. Feel free to skip this
exercise.
		
Exclude the AWT and Swing packages from the Eclipse Java tools
via the
menu:Window[Preferences > Java > Appearance > Type Filters]
setting. Press the
btn:[Add Packages...]
button and add the
`java.awt` and `javax.swing`

packages as depicted in the following screenshot.

=== Activate Save Actions
		
Eclipse allows you to organize the Java imports and format your
source code in the Java editor every time you save. To enable this
select the

menu:Window[Preferences > Java > Editor > Save Actions]
menu
and select that the source code should be formated and that the
imports
should be
organized at every save action.
