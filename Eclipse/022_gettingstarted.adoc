== Getting started with Eclipse

=== Starting the Eclipse IDE
		
To start Eclipse, double-click the
`eclipse.exe`
(Microsoft Windows) or
`eclipse`
(Linux / Mac) file in the directory where you
unpacked Eclipse.
		
The Eclipse system
prompts you for a
_workspace_.
The
_workspace_
is
the location in your file system where Eclipse stores its
preferences and other resources. For example your
projects can be stored in the workspace.
		
Select
an empty directory
and click the
_OK_
button.

page
by
clicking the
_x_
beside
_Welcome_.
