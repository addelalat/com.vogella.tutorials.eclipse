== Important Eclipse terminology

=== Workspace

The _workspace_ is the physical location (file path) you are storing certain meta-data and (optional) your development artifacts.
Your projects, source files, images and other artifacts can be stored inside or outside your workspace. 
The meta-data stored for the workspace contains preferences settings, plug-in specific meta data, logs etc.

You can choose the workspace during startup of Eclipse or via the menu:File[Switch Workspace > Others] menu entry.
You typically use different _workspaces_ if you require different settings or if you want to divide your work.
	
[NOTE]
====
It is not mandatory that a project resides within the workspace directory.
It is possible to refer to external resources (e.g., projects) from  the _workspace_.

=== Views and editors

Eclipse provides _views_ and _editors_ to navigate and change content.
View and editors can be grouped into _perspectives_.

A view is typically used to work on a set of data.
This data might be a hierarchical structure. 
If data is changed via the view, the underlying data is directly changed, without the need to save.

For example, the _Project Explorer_ view allows you to browse and modify files of Eclipse projects.
Any change in the _Project Explorer_ is directly applied to the files, e.g., if you rename a file, the file system is directly changed.

Editors are typically used to modify a single data element, e.g., the content of a file or a data object.
Change in an editor are only applied once the user saves.

For example, the _Java_ editor is used to modify Java source files. 
Changes to the source file are applied once the user selects the btn:[Save] button.
A editor with changed data (a dirty editor) is marked with an asterisk left to the name of the modified file.

=== Eclipse projects

An Eclipse project contains source, configuration and binary files related to a certain task. 
It groups them into buildable and reusable units.
An Eclipse project can have _natures_ assigned to it which describe the purpose of this project. 
For example, the Java _nature_ defines a project as Java project. 
Projects can have multiple natures combined to model different technical aspects.

_Natures_ for a project are defined via the _.project_ file in the project directory.
