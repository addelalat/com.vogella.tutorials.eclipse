== Important Eclipse terminology

=== How is the Eclipse IDE structured?

Eclipse provides
_Perspectives_,
_Views_
and
_Editors_.
_Views_
and
_Editors_
are grouped into
_Perspectives_.

=== Workspace

The
_workspace_
is the physical location (file path) you are
working in. Your
projects,
source files, images and other artifacts
can be
stored and
saved in
your workspace. The
_workspace_
also contains preferences settings, plug-in specific meta data, logs
etc.

You typically use different
_workspaces_
if
you require different settings for your project or if you
want to
divide your projects into separate directories.

NOTE: It is not mandatory that a project resides within the
_workspace_
directory.
It is
possible to refer to external
resources
(e.g.,
projects)
from
the
_workspace_.

You can
choose the workspace during startup of
Eclipse or
via the menu
(menu:File[Switch Workspace > Others]).

=== Eclipse projects

An Eclipse project contains source, configuration and binary
files
related to a
certain task and groups them into
buildable and
reusable
units. An Eclipse project can have
_natures_
assigned to it which describe the purpose of this project. For
example, the Java
_nature_
defines a project as Java project. Projects can have multiple natures
combined to model different technical aspects.


_Natures_
for a project are defined via the
_.project_
file in the project directory.

Projects in Eclipse cannot contain other projects. 

=== Views or editors

Individual elements (part) of the Eclipse UI
are typically classified into
_views_
and
_editors_.

A
view
is
typically
used to work on a set of data, which might be a
hierarchical
structure. If data
is
changed via the
view,
this change is
typically directly applied to the
underlying data
structure. A
view
sometimes allows the user to open
an
editor
for the selected set of data.

An example for a
view in the Eclipse IDE
is the
_Project Explorer_, which allows you to browse the files of Eclipse projects. If you
change data in the
_Project Explorer_, e.g.,
if you rename a file, the
file
name
is directly changed on the
file
system.

Editors
are
typically used to modify a single data element, e.g.,
the content of a
file or a
data object. To apply
the
changes made in an
editor to the
data
structure, the user has to explicitly save the
editor content.

For example, the
_Java_
editor
is used to modify Java source files. Changes to the source file
are
applied once the user selects the
btn:[Save] button. A dirty editor tab is marked with an asterisk
left to the
name of the modified file.
