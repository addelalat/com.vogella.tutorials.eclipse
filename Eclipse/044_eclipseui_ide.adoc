== The Eclipse user interface

=== Toolbar

The application toolbar contains actions which you typically perform, e.g., creating Java resources or running Java projects. 
It also allows you to switch between perspectives.

=== Perspectives in Eclipse
		
Eclipse provides different perspectives for different tasks.
The available perspectives_depend on your installation.
For Java development you usually use the _Java Perspective_, but Eclipse has much more predefined perspectives, e.g., the _Debug_ perspective.
		
Eclipse allows you to switch to another perspective via the menu:Window+Perspective[Open Perspective > Other...] menu entry.
				
Open editors are typically shared between perspectives, i.e., if you have an editor open in the _Java_ perspective for a certain class and switch to the _Debug_ perspective, this editor stays open.

You can switch perspectives via the menu:Window+Perspective[Open Perspective > Other...] menu entry.
		
The main perspectives used for Java development are the _Java_ perspective and the _Debug_ perspective.

The Java perspective can be opened via menu:Window+Perspective[Open Perspective > Java].

On the left hand side, this perspective shows the _Package Explorer_ view, which allows you to browse your projects and to select the components you want to open in an editor via a double-click.
		
For example, to open a Java source file, open the tree under `src`, select the corresponding _.java_ file and double-click it. This will open the file in the default Java editor.
		
The following picture shows the default Java perspective. 
The _Package Explorer_ view is on the left. 
In the middle you see the open editors. 
Several editors are stacked in the same container and you can switch between them by clicking on the corresponding tab.
Via drag and drop you can move an editor to a new position in the Eclipse IDE.

To the right and below the editor area you find more views which were considered useful by the developer of the perspective. 
For example, the _Javadoc_ view shows the Javadoc of the selected class or method.
		
=== Resetting and customizing a perspective
		
A common problem is that you changed the arrangement of views and editors in your perspective and you want to restore its original state. 
For example, you might have closed a view.
You can reset a perspective to its original state via the menu:Window[Perspective > Reset Perspective...] menu entry.
		
You can change the layout and content within a perspective by opening or closing parts and by re-arranging them.
		
To open a new part in your current perspective, use the menu:Window[Show View > Other...] menu entry. 
This opens the _Show View_ dialog which allows you to search for certain parts.

If you want to reset your current perspective to its default, use the menu:Window[Reset Perspective] menu entry.
		
You can save the currently selected perspective via menu:Window+Perspective[Save Perspective As...].

The menu:Window+Perspective[Customize Perspective...] menu entry allows you to adjust the selected perspective. For example, you can hide or show toolbar and menu entries.
