[[perspective_ide">
=== Perspectives in Eclipse
		
			Eclipse provides different
			_perspectives_
			for different tasks.
			The available
			_perspectives_
			depend on your installation.
			For Java development you
			usually use the
			_Java Perspective_
			, but Eclipse has much more predefined
			_perspectives_
			, e.g., the
			_Debug_
			_perspective_
			.
		
		
			Eclipse allows you to
			switch to another
			_perspective_
			via the
			menu:Window</guimenu>Perspective[Open Perspective > Other...]
			menu entry.
		
		
			Open
			editors
			are typically shared between
			perspectives, i.e., if you have
			an
			editor
			open in the
			_Java_
			perspective
			for a certain class and switch to the
			_Debug_
			perspective, this
			_editor_
			stays open.
		
		

			You can switch
			_Perspectives_
			via the
			menu:Window</guimenu>Perspective[Open Perspective > Other...]
			menu entry.
		
		
			The main perspectives used for Java development are the
			_Java_
			perspective
			and the
			_Debug_
			perspective
			.
			The Java perspective can be opened via
			menu:Window</guimenu>Perspective[Open Perspective > Java]
			.

			On the left hand side, this perspective shows the
			_Package Explorer_
			view,
			which allows you to browse your
			_projects_
			and to select the
			components you want to open in an editor via a
			double-click.
		
		
			For example, to open
			a Java source file, open the tree under
			<code>src</code>
			,
			select the corresponding
			<filename>.java</filename>
			file and double-click it. This will open the file in the
			default Java
			_editor_
			.
		
		
			The following picture shows the default Java
			perspective. The
			_Package Explorer_
			view
			is on the left. In the middle
			you
			see the
			open
			editors. Several
			editors
			are stacked in the same container and you can
			switch between them by
			clicking on the corresponding tab.
			Via drag and
			drop you can move an
			editor to a new position in the Eclipse IDE.

			To the right and below the editor area you find more
			_views_
			which were considered useful by the developer of the
			perspective. For
			example, the
			_Javadoc_
			view
			shows the Javadoc of the selected class or method.
		
	

[[perspective_resetcustomize">
=== Resetting and customizing a perspective
		
			A common problem is that you changed the arrangement of views and
			editors in your
			_perspective_
			and you want to restore Eclipse to its original state. For example,
			you might have closed a
			view
			.
			You can reset a
			_perspective_
			to its original
			state
			via the
			menu:Window[Perspective > Reset Perspective...]
			menu entry.
		
		
			You can change the layout and content within a
			perspective
			by
			opening or closing
			parts
			and by re-arranging them.
		
		
			To open a new
			part
			in your current
			perspective,
			use the
			menu:Window[Show View > Other...]
			menu entry. The following
			_Show View_
			dialog allows you to search for certain
			_parts_
			.

			If you want to reset your current
			perspective
			to its default,
			use the
			menu:Window[Reset Perspective]
			menu entry.
		

		
			You can save the currently selected
			perspective
			via
			menu:Window</guimenu>Perspective[Save Perspective As...]
			.

			The

			menu entry allows you to adjust the selected

			hide or show toolbar and menu entries.
