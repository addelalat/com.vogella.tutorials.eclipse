== The Eclipse Java perspective

=== Package Explorer view
		
The _Package Explorer_ view allows you to browse the structure of your projects and to open files in an _editor_ via a double-click on the file.
		
It is also used to change the structure of your project. 
For example, you can rename files or move files and folders via drag and drop.
A right-click on a file or folder shows you the available options.
