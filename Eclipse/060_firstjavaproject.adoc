== Create your first Java program

=== Target of this exercise

The following section describes how to create a minimal Java
application
using Eclipse. It is tradition in the programming world to
create a
small program which writes "Hello World" to the console. We
will
adapt
this tradition and will
write "Hello Eclipse!" to the
console.

=== Create project

This $book uses the naming convention that the project is named
the same as the top-level package in the project.

Select
menu:File[New > Java project]
from the menu. Enter
`de.vogella.eclipse.ide.first`
as the project name. Select the
_Create separate folders for sources and class files_ flag.

Press the
_Finish_
button to create the project. A new project is created
and
displayed as
a folder. Open the
`de.vogella.eclipse.ide.first`
folder and explore the content of this folder.

=== Create package

In the following step you create a new
`package`. A good convention for the project and package name is to use the
same name
for the top level package
and
the
project. For example, if you
name your project
`com.example.javaproject`
you should also use
`com.example.javaproject`
as the top-level package name.

To create the
`de.vogella.eclipse.ide.first`
package, select the
`src`
folder
, right-click on it and select menu:New[Package].

TIP: Reverse domain names should be used for packages to prevent
name
clashes. It is relatively unlikely that another company defines a
class called
`test`
in the
`com.vogella`
package because this is the reverse URL of the vogella GmbH company.

Enter the name of your new package in the dialog and press the
_Finish_
button.

=== Create Java class

Create a Java class. Right-click on your package and
select
menu:New[Class].

Enter
`MyFirstClass`
as the class name and
select the
_public static void main
(String[] args)
_
checkbox.

Press the
_Finish_
button.

This creates a new file and opens the Java
_editor_.
Change the class based on the following listing.

[source,java]
----
include::res/firstexample/MyFirstClass.java[]
----

You could also directly create new packages via this dialog. If
you enter a new package in this dialog, it is created automatically.

=== Run your project in Eclipse

Now run your code. Either right-click on your Java class in the
_Package Explorer_
or right-click in the Java class and
select
menu:Run-as[Java application].

Eclipse will run your Java program. You should see the output in
the
_Console_
view
.

Congratulations! You created your first Java project, a
package,
a Java class and you ran this program inside
Eclipse.
