== Run Java program outside Eclipse

=== Create JAR file
		
To run the Java program outside of the Eclipse IDE, you need to
export
it as a
_JAR_
file. A
_JAR_
file is the standard distribution format for Java applications.
		
Select your project, right-click it and select the
_Export_
menu entry.

Select
_JAR file_
and select the
_Next_
button.
Select your project and enter
the
export destination and a
name
for the
_JAR_
file. I named it
`myprogram.jar`.

Press The
_Finish_
button. This creates a
_JAR_
file in your selected output
directory.
		
=== Run your program outside Eclipse
		
Open a command shell, e.g., under Microsoft Windows select
menu:Start[Run]
and type
`cmd`
and press the Enter key. This should open a console window.
		
Switch to the directory which contains the
_JAR_
file
, by
typing
`cd path`. For example, if
your
_JAR_ is located in
_c:\temp_,
use the following command.
		
[source,txt]
----
include::res/snippets/cd.txt[]
----
		
To run this program, include the
_JAR_
file
in your
_classpath_. The
_classpath_
defines which Java classes are available to the Java
runtime. You can
add a
_JAR_
file to the classpath with the
_-classpath_
option.
		
[source,txt]
----
include::res/firstexample/run.txt[]
----
		
Type the above command in the directory you used for the export
and you see the "Hello Eclipse!" output in your
command shell.
