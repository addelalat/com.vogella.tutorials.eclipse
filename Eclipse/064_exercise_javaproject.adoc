== Exercise: Java project, packages and import statements

=== Create project

Create a new Java project called _com.vogella.ide.counter_.


Create the following packages:

* `com.vogella.ide.counter.util`
* `com.vogella.ide.counter.main`

=== Create classes

Create the following `Counter` class in the `*.util` package.

[source,java]
----
include::res/first/Counter.java[]
----

Create the following `Tester` class in the `*.main` package. 
This is a simple class without the usage of any unit testing framework like _JUnit_.
The Eclipse editor should mark the created class with an error because the required `import` statements are missing.

[source,java]
----
include::res/first/Tester1.java[]
----

Right-click in your Java editor and select menu:Source[Organize Imports] to add the required import statements to your Java class.

This should remove the syntax error. Finish the implementation for the `Tester` class based on the following code.

[source,java]
----
include::res/first/Tester.java[]
----

The `Counter` class had in its source code a comment starting with _TODO_. 
Finish the source code and calculate the correct values.

Run the `Tester` class and validate that your implementation is correct.
The `Tester` class checks for an example value but the method should work for different input values.
