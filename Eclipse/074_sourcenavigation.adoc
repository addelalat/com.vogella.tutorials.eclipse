== Source navigation in the Eclipse IDE

=== Package Explorer or Project Explorer

The primary way of navigating through your project is the
_Package Explorer_
or alternatively the
_Project Explorer_
view. You can open nodes in the tree and open a file in an editor
by
double-clicking on the corresponding entry in the
tree hierarchy.

image::packageexplorer10_display.png[Package Explorer display,pdfwidth=40%]

The drop-down menu in the
_Package Explorer_
allows you to filter
the resources which should be displayed or
hidden.

image::packageexplorer20_filter.png[Filter in the package explorer,pdfwidth=40%]

image::packageexplorer22_filter.png[Filter in the package explorer,pdfwidth=40%]

=== Link Package Explorer with editor

The
_Package Explorer_
view
allows you to display the associated file from
the
currently selected
editor. For example, if you are working on the
`Foo.java`
file in the Java
_editor_
and
switch to the Java
_editor_
of the
`Var.java`
file,
then the corresponding file will be selected in
the
_Package Explorer_
view.

To activate this behavior, press the
_Link with Editor_
button in
the
_Package explorer_ view
as depicted in the following screenshot.

image::editorsyncpackage10.png[Synchronize the package explorer selectioni with the current selected editor,pdfwidth=40%]

=== Opening a class

You can navigate between the classes in your project via the
_Package Explorer_
view
as described before. You can navigate the tree and open a file via
a double-click.

In addition, you can open any class by positioning the cursor
on
the
class
in
an editor and pressing
kbd:[F3]. 
Alternatively, you can press kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+T]. 
This shows the following dialog in which you can enter the
class name
to open
it.


image::classopen10.png[Opening a class,pdfwidth=60%]


You can also search for package names. Each part of the package name
must end with a
`.`
(the
_dot_
character)
so that the
_Open Type Dialog_
can identify it as a package.

TIP: You only need to specify part of each
segment of the package name.
Assume, for example, that you search for
the
_org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Button_
class. To
find this class, you can use the search term
_org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Button_
or
_o.e.s.w.Button_
or
_o.Button_
.

image::classopen20.png[Opening a class with package name,pdfwidth=60%]

The
_Open Type Dialog_
also supports
_CamelCase_
like
search, e.g., it matches capital letters in the class name. For
example, if you would search for the
`OnTouchListener`
class you could use
_OTL_
or
_OToList_
as search term.

image::classopen30.png[Opening a class with CamelCase,pdfwidth=60%]

TIP: To avoid suffix matching, you can add a space after the class name.
For
example, you can type
_Selection_
(there is a space after selection) to match the
`Selection`
class but not the
`SelectionListener`
class. Wildcards like * are also supported.

=== Open Resource dialog to open arbitrary files

You can open any file from your open projects via the
_Open Resource_
dialog. You can open this dialog via the
kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+R]
shortcut. This dialog allows to enter the file name
and to open or show it in a selected view. The following
screenshot demonstrate the usage to open a pom.xml file from your workspace.

image::openresourceeclipse10.png[Open resources in Eclipse,pdfwidth=40%]

=== Quick Outline

_Quick Outline_
shows you an structured overview of the file you are editing.
For example, for a Java class you see its methods with
the
option
to filter.
The shortcut for opening the
_Quick Outline_
is
kbd:[Ctrl+O]
. You can also reach this option, via right-click in an editor via the
_Quick Outline_
option.

By default,
_Quick Outline_
shows only the direct members and fields of the Java class. Press
kbd:[Ctrl+O]
again to show also the inherited members and fields.

The default look of the
_Quick Outline_
option is similar to the
_Quick Outline_
view
of the
_Java_
_perspective_
.

=== Open Type Hierarchy

The type hierarchy of a class shows you which classes it extends
and
which interfaces it implements. You can use
the type hierarchy to
navigate to one of these elements.

To open the type
hierarchy of the
selected class, right-click
in
the
editor and
select
_Open Type Hierarchy_
(Shortcut:
kbd:[F4]
) or
_Quick Type Hierarchy_
(Shortcut:
kbd:[Ctrl+T]
).

=== Full text search

You frequently need to find files containing certain text or other meta data. Via the
menu:
Search[Search]
menu (Shortcut:
kbd:[Ctrl+H]
) you can open the search dialog of Eclipse. Use the
_File Search_
tab to search for text with the option to use regular expressions and also to replace matching entries.

image::javasearchdialog30.png[Text search,pdfwidth=60%]

Eclipse associates file extensions with the default tab. You can
customize the available search tabs via the
_Customize_
button in the Search dialog. Via the
_Remember the last used page_
you can configure Eclipse to use your last tab as default.

image::customizesearch10.png[Customize search,pdfwidth=60%]

image::customizesearch20.png[Customize search,pdfwidth=60%]

=== Java search and other specialized searches

The Search functionality (
kbd:[Ctrl+H]
) others specialized searches for more complex use cases.
For example, use the
_Java Search_
tab to search for Java elements, e.g.,
methods.

image::javasearchdialog10.png[Text search,pdfwidth=60%]

The
_Search_
view
shows the search results for the selected scope. You can
double-click
on a
search
entry to navigate to the
corresponding
position in the
editor. The currently selected search result is also indicated via an
arrow in the left
border of the editor.

image::javasearchdialog20.png[Text search,pdfwidth=60%]

=== Inline search in an editor

You can use the
kbd:[Ctrl+J]
shortcut to activate
_Incremental Find_
. This allows you to search in the current active editor for a text
which is displayed in the status line as depicted
by the following
screenshot. Repeat
kbd:[Ctrl+J]
in order to move to the next
occurrence of the current search term.

image::incrementalsearch10.png[Incrementation search,pdfwidth=30%,width=30%]

The advantage of this search is that no pop-up dialog is opened
which blocks other elements in the Eclipse IDE.

If you have selected an element in the editor, you can use the
kbd:[Ctrl+K]
shortcut to search for the next occurrence of the selected text and
kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+K]
for the previous element.

=== Annotation navigations

You can also navigate via the annotation buttons, e.g., for
jumping
to the next error or warning in your source
code.

image::navigation_annotations10.png[Annotation navigation,pdfwidth=40%]

By pressing the buttons you can navigate to the related
annotations.
You can also use the keyboard shortcut
kbd:[Ctrl+.]
(Ctrl plus the dot sign)
for selecting the next annotation or
kbd:[Ctrl+,]
(Ctrl plus the comma sign)
for selecting the previous annotation.

The following screenshot shows source code with two warnings
and
one error and you can navigate between the
corresponding code via the
annotation buttons.

image::annotationsnavigation30.png[Moving in the source code,pdfwidth=40%]

Which annotations are relevant for navigation can be configured
via the drop-down menu of the toolbar. This
selection is highlighted
in the following screenshot.

image::navigation_annotations20.png[Annotation navigation,pdfwidth=40%]

=== Mouse and keyboard navigation

In a lot of cases you can also use the mouse to navigate to or
into an
element if you press the
kbd:[Ctrl]
key. For example, press the
kbd:[Ctrl]
key and (left) click with the mouse on the name of a class to jump
into the class
declaration.

Similar to the left mouse click combined with the
kbd:[Ctrl]
,
you can use the
kbd:[F3]
key to go into a class.

=== Show in Breadcrumb

You can also activate the
_breadcrumb_
mode for the Java editor
which allows you to navigate the source code
directly from the Java
editor.

You can activate this mode via right-click in the editor and by
selecting the
_Show in Breadcrumb_
entry.

image::breadcrumb10.png[Show in Breadcrumb,pdfwidth=60%]

This allows you to navigate the source code from the editor as
depicted in the following screenshot.

image::breadcrumb20.png[Breadcrumb view,pdfwidth=60%]

To hide it again, right-click on a breadcrump entry and select
_Hide Breadcrumb_
.

image::breadcrumb30.png[Breadcrumb view,pdfwidth=60%]

=== Shortcuts

There are a lot of shortcuts available for navigation.
Please
check
the appendix of this $book for these shortcuts or
open
menu:Window+Preferences[General > Keys]
to find and redefine shortcuts at
runtime.

=== Closing and opening projects

Closing projects saves memory in Eclipse and can reduce the build
time. Eclipse ignores closed
projects, e.g., all
searches ignore files from closed projects. Also the
_Problems_
view
does only shows errors of opened projects. This typically helps you
focus your attention on the project. You can
close projects via a right-click on it and by selecting the
_Close Project_
menu entry.
Alternatively, if you work on a project, you can close all
unrelated
projects via a right-click on it and by
selecting the
_Close Unrelated Projects_
menu entry.

To open a
closed project double-click on it, or right-click it
and
select
_Open Project_
.

You can
use the filter functionality for the
_Package Explorer_
view
to hide the closed projects.
