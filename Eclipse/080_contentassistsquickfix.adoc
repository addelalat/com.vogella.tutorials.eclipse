== Content Assist and Quick Fix

=== Content assist
		
_Content assist_
is a functionality in Eclipse which allows the developer to get
context-sensitive code
completion in an editor upon user request.
		
It can
be invoked by pressing
kbd:[Ctrl+Space]
.
		
For example, type
`syso`
in the editor of a Java source file
and
then press
kbd:[Ctrl+Space]
. This will replace
`syso`
with
`System.out.println("")`
.
		
If you have a reference to an object, for example, the object
`person`
of the type
`Person`
and
need to see its
methods, type
`person.`
and
press
kbd:[Ctrl+Space]
.

=== Quick Fix
		
Whenever Eclipse detects a problem, it will underline the
problematic
text in the editor. Select the underlined text and press
kbd:[Ctrl+1]
to see proposals how to solve this problem. This functionality is
called
_Quick Fix_
.
		
For example, type
`myBoolean = true;`
If myBoolean is not yet
defined, Eclipse will highlight it as an
error. Select the variable
and press
kbd:[Ctrl+1].
Eclipse will
suggest creating a field or
local variable.

_Quick Fix_
is extremely powerful. For example, it allows you to
create new
local
variables and fields as well as new methods and new
classes. Or it
can
put
`try/catch` statements
around your exceptions. It
can also
assign a
statement
to a variable and much more.
		
_Quick Fix_
also gives several options for code changes on code which does not
contain errors, e.g., it allows you to convert a local variable to a
field.
