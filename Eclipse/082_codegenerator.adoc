== Generating code
	
Eclipse has several possibilities to generate code for you. This
can save significant time during development.
	
For example, Eclipse can override methods from superclasses and
generate the
`toString()`
,
`hashcode()`
and
`equals()`
methods. It
can also generate getter and setter methods for attributes
of
your Java class.
	
You can find these options in the Source menu.

To test the source generation, create the following class in your
`de.vogella.eclipse.ide.first`
project.
	
[source,java]
----
include::res/codegen/Person.java[]
----
	
Select
menu:Source[Generate Constructor using Fields...], mark both fields and click the btn:[OK] button.
