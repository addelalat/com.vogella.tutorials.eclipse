== Exercise: code generation and content assists

=== Introduction
		
In this exercise you practice the usage of code generation and
the
usage of the
_Content Assists_
functionality.

=== Create project
		
Create a project called
`com.vogella.ide.todo`
.

=== Create class
		
Create the
`com.vogella.ide.todo`
package
and the
following class.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/net/TodoBase.java[]
----		
		
Select
menu:Source[Generate Constructor using Fields...]
to generate a constructor using all fields.

Use the
menu:Source[Generate Getter and Setter]
to create getters and setters for all fields.
		
The resulting class should look like the following listing.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/net/Todo.java[]
----
		
Use Eclipse to generate a
`toString()`
method for the
`Todo`
class based on the
_id_
and
_summary_
field.

This can be done via the Eclipse menu
menu:Source[Generate toString()...]
.

Also
use Eclipse to generate a
`hashCode()`
and
`equals()`
method based on the
_id_
field. This can be done via the
Eclipse menu
menu:Source[Generate hashCode() and equals()...]
.

=== Create instances
		
Create a new class called
`TodoProvider`
.
Create the following static method in your
`TodoProvider`
class.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/net/TodoProvider.java[]
----		

=== Write a test class
		
Write another
`TodoProviderTest`
class
with a
`public static void main (String[] args)`
method.
		
In your main method call the
`createInitialModel`
method and validate that the returned number of
items is 5.
		
If another number than 5 is returned, throw a
`RuntimeException`
. If the correct number is returned, write the String "Correct" to
the
_Console_
view
.
		
Use
_Content assist_
to create the
`System.out.println()`
based on
`syso`
for you.

=== Example implementation of TodoProviderTest
		
While this exercise was about code generation and content
assits,
you might be interested in a potential solution for this exercise. The
following listing contains a potential solution.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/net/TodoProviderTest.java[]
