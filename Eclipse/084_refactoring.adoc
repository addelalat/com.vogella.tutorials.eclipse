== Refactoring

=== Refactoring

_Refactoring_
is the process of restructuring the code without
changing its
behavior. For example, renaming a Java class or method is
a refactoring
activity.

=== Refactoring in Eclipse

Eclipse supports several refactoring activities, for example,
renaming
or
moving.

For example, to use the
_Rename_
refactoring, you can right-click on your class (in the editor or
Package Explorer) and
select
menu:Refactor[Rename]
to rename your class. Eclipse will make sure that all calls
in your
Workspace to
your class or method are renamed.

The following screenshot shows how to call the
_Rename_
refactoring for a class. The cursor is positioned on the class and
the context menu is activated via a right-click on the class.

The most important refactorings are listed in the following
table.

.Refactoring
|===
|Refactoring |Description

|Rename
|Rename a variable or class

|Extract Method
|Creates a method based on the selected code in the editor

|Extract Constant
|Gives magic numbers or hard-coded strings a descriptive constant name and replaces all occurences.
|===

TIP: Lots of refactorings are also available via the kbd:[Ctrl+1]
shortcut (
_quick fix_
). Select a certain part of your code and press
kbd:[Ctrl+1]
to see possible refactorings for the selected
position.

Eclipse has many more refactorings. The available options
depend on the selection in the Java editor. In most cases you should
get
an idea of the performed action by the naming of the refactoring
operation.
