		<para>
			Eclipse supports several refactoring activities, for example,
			renaming
			or
			moving.
		</para>

		<para>
			For example, to use the
			<wordasword>Rename</wordasword>
			refactoring, you can right-click on your class (in the editor or
			Package Explorer) and
			select
			<menuchoice>
				<guimenu>Refactor</guimenu>
				<guisubmenu>Rename</guisubmenu>
			</menuchoice>
			to rename your class. Eclipse will make sure that all calls
			in your
			Workspace to
			your class or method are renamed.
		</para>

		<para>
			The following screenshot shows how to call the
			<guilabel>Rename</guilabel>
			refactoring for a class. The cursor is positioned on the class and
			the context menu is activated via a right-click on the class.
		</para>

		<para>
			The most important refactorings are listed in the following
			table.
			<table frame='all'>
				<title>Refactoring</title>
				<tgroup cols='2' align='left' colsep='1' rowsep='1'>
					<colspec colname='c1' colwidth="1*" />

						</row>
					</tbody>
				</tgroup>
			</table>

		</para>
		<tip>
			<para>
				Lots of refactorings are also available via the
				<keycombo>
					<keycap>Ctrl</keycap>
					<keycap>1</keycap>
				</keycombo>
				shortcut (
				<wordasword>quick fix</wordasword>
				). Select a certain part of your code and press
				<keycombo>
					<keycap>Ctrl</keycap>
					<keycap>1</keycap>
				</keycombo>
				to see possible refactorings for the selected
				position.
			</para>
		</tip>
		<para> Eclipse has many more refactorings. The available options
			depend on the selection in the Java editor. In most cases you should
			get
			an idea of the performed action by the naming of the refactoring
			operation.
