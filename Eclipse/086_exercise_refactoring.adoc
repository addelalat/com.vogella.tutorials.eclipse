== Exercise: Refactoring

=== Preparation
		
For the next examples change the
`MyFirstClass`
class to
the following code.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/refactoring/MyFirstClassVrs1.java[]
----

=== Extract method
		
A useful refactoring is to mark code and create a method from the selected code. 
To use this in this exercise, mark the coding of the "for" loop, right click on the selection and select menu:Refactoring [Extract Method]. 
Use _calculateSum_ as the name of the new method.

After this refactoring the class should look like the following code.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/refactoring/MyFirstClassVrs2.java[]
----

=== Extract Constant
		
You can also extract strings and create constants based on the
strings. Mark for
this example the
`"Hello Eclipse!"`
string in your source code, right-click on it and
select
menu:Refactor[Extract Constant]. Name your new constant `HELLO`.

The string is now defined as a constant.
