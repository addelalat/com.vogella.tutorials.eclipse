== Exercise: Refactoring

=== Preparation

		
			For the next examples change the
			`MyFirstClass`
			class to
			the following code.
		
		
			<programlisting>
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="../examples/refactoring/MyFirstClassVrs1.java" />
			</programlisting>
		
	

=== Extract method
		
			A useful refactoring is to mark code and create a method
			from
			the
			selected code. To use this in this exercise, mark the coding of the
			"for" loop, right
			click on the selection and
			select
			menu:Refactoring [Extract Method]
			. Use
			_calculateSum_
			as the name of the new method.

		 After this refactoring the class should look like the following code.
		
			<programlisting>
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="../examples/refactoring/MyFirstClassVrs2.java" />
			</programlisting>
		

	

=== Extract Constant
		
			You can also extract strings and create constants based on the
			strings. Mark for
			this example the
			`"Hello Eclipse!"`
			string in your source code, right-click on it and
			select
			menu:Refactor[Extract Constant]
			. Name your new constant `HELLO`.

		The string is now defined as a constant.

				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="../examples/refactoring/MyFirstClassVrs3.java" />
