== Using project dependencies

You can define in Eclipse that a project is dependent on another
project.
To do this
select your project, right-click on it and select
_Properties_.
	
Select
_Java Build Path_
and the
_Projects_
tab.

If you add a project to the build path of another project, you
can use its
classes in Eclipse.
	
This only works within Eclipse; outside of it you need to
create Java libraries for the projects and add them to the classpath
of your Java application.
