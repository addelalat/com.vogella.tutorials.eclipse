	<title>Using project dependencies

	
		You can define in Eclipse that a project is dependent on another
		project.
		To do this
		select your project, right-click on it and select
		_Properties_
		.
	
	
		Select
		_Java Build Path_
		and the
		_Projects_
		tab.

	If you add a project to the build path of another project, you
		can use its
		classes in Eclipse.
	
	This only works within Eclipse; outside of it you need to
		create Java libraries for the projects and add them to the classpath
		of your Java application.
