== Using JARs (libraries) in Eclipse

=== Adding a Java library to the project classpath

If the libraries should be distributed with your project, you can store the JAR files directly in your project.

For example, you can create a new Java project `de.vogella.eclipse.ide.jars`. 
Then create a new folder called `lib` by right-clicking on your project and selecting menu:New[Folder].

From the menu select menu:File[Import > General > File System].

Select the Java library you want to import and select the _lib_ folder as target. 
Alternatively, just copy and paste the `jar` file into the _lib_ folder.

You can add this library to your classpath, right-click on the JAR file and select menu:Build Path[Add to Build Path].

To manage your classpath, right-click on your project and select
_Properties_.
Under
menu:Java Build Path[Libraries]
select the
btn:[Add JARs]
button.

The following example shows how the result would look like
if
the
_junit-4.4.jar_
file
had been added to the project.

After adding it to the classpath, Eclipse allows you to use the classes contained in the JAR file in the project. 
Outside Eclipse you still need to configure your classpath, e.g., via the _MANIFEST.MF_ file.

=== Attach source code to a Java library

You can open any class by positioning the
cursor on
the class in
an
editor and pressing
kbd:[F3]. 
Alternatively, you
can
press
kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+T]. This will show a dialog in which you can enter
the
class name to open
it.

If the source code is not
available,
the editor
will show the
bytecode
of that class.

This happens, for example, if you open a class from a the standard
Java library without attaching the
source code to it.

To see the source code of such a class, you can
attach a source
archive or source folder
to a Java
library. Afterwards, the editor
shows
the source instead of
the
bytecode.

Attaching the source code to a library also allows you to
debug
this
source code.

The _Source Attachment_ dialog can be reached in the
_Java Build Path_
page of a project. To open this page, right-click on a project and
select
menu:Properties[Java Build Path]. On the
_Libraries_
tab, expand the library's node, select the
_Source Attachment_
attribute and click the
btn:[Edit]
button.

In the Location path field, enter the path of an archive or a
folder containing the source.

The following screenshot shows this setting for the standard Java
library. If you
have
the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed, you
should find the
source
in the JDK installation folder. The file is
typically called
_src.zip_.

=== Add Javadoc for a JAR
 
It is also possible to add Javadoc to a library which you use.

Download the Javadoc of the JAR file and put it somewhere in
your
filesystem.

To enter the location of the Javadoc, open the
_Java Build Path_
via a
right-click on a project and select
menu:Properties[Java Build Path]. On the
_Libraries_
tab expand the
library's node, select the
_Javadoc location_
attribute and press the
btn:[Edit]
button.

Enter the location to the file which contains the Javadoc.
