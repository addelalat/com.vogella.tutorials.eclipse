== Updates and installation of plug-ins

=== Eclipse update manager

The Eclipse IDE contains a software component called
_Update Manager_
which allows you
to install and
update
software components. Installable
software components are
called
`features`
and consist of
`plug-ins`
.

These features are contained in so-called
_update sites_
or
_software sites_. An
_update site_
contains
installable software components
and additional configuration
files. It can be located in various places, e.g., on a web server or
on the local filesystem.

The configuration files
provide
aggregated information about the
software
components in the
_update site_.
The update functionality in Eclipse uses this
information to
determine which software components are
available in
which
version. This
allows the Eclipse update functionality to download only components
which are new or updated.

=== Performing an update and install new features

WARNING: If you are behind a network proxy, you have to configure your proxy
via the
menu:Window[Preferences > General > Network Connection]
preference setting. Otherwise, Eclipse may not able to reach the
update sites.

To update your Eclipse installation, select
menu:Help[Check for Updates]
.
The system searches for updates of the already installed
software
components. If it finds updated components, it will ask you
to
approve
the update.

To install a new functionality, select
menu:Help[Install New Software...]
.

From the
_Work with_
list, select or enter a URL from which you would
like
to
install new
software
components. Entering a new URL adds this URL automatically
to
the list of available update sites.

To explicitly add a new update site, press the
_Add..._
button
and
enter
the new URL as well
as a name for the new update site.

The following update sites contain the official Eclipse
components.

If you select a valid update site, Eclipse allows you to
install
the available components. Check the components which you want
to
install.

If you can't find a certain component, uncheck the
_Group
items
by category
_
checkbox because
not all
available plug-ins are categorized. If they
are not
categorized, they
will not be displayed, unless the grouping
is
disabled.

=== See the installed components

To see which components are installed, use
menu:Help[About Eclipse SDK > Installation Details]
.

=== Uninstalling components

If you select
menu:Help[About Eclipse SDK]
and then the
_Installation Details_
button, you can uninstall components from your Eclipse IDE.

=== Restarting Eclipse

After an update or an installation of a new software component,
you should restart Eclipse to make sure that the changes are
applied.
