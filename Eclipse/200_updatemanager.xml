=== Eclipse update manager
		<indexterm>
			<primary>Update manager of the Eclipse IDE</primary>
		</indexterm>
		
			The Eclipse IDE contains a software component called
			_Update Manager_
			which allows you
			to install and
			update
			software components. Installable
			software components are
			called
			<code>features</code>
			and consist of
			<code>plug-ins</code>
			.
		

		
			These features are contained in so-called
			_update sites_
			or
			_software sites_
			. An
			_update site_
			contains
			installable software components
			and additional configuration
			files. It can be located in various places, e.g., on a web server or
			on the local filesystem.
		

		
			The configuration files
			provide
			aggregated information about the
			software
			components in the
			_update site_
			.
			The update functionality in Eclipse uses this
			information to
			determine which software components are
			available in
			which
			version. This
			allows the Eclipse update functionality to download only components
			which are new or updated.
