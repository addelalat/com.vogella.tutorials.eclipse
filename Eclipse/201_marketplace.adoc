== Eclipse Marketplace
	
Eclipse also contains a client which allows installing software
components from the Eclipse
_Marketplace client_
. The advantage of this client
is
that you can search for components,
discover popular
extensions and
see descriptions and ratings.
	
Compared to the update manager, you do not have to know
the
URL
for
the
_software site_
which contains the installable software components.
	
Not all Eclipse distributions contain the
_Marketplace client_
by
default. You may need to install the
_Marketplace client_
software component into Eclipse before you can use it. The following
screenshot shows how to install it from one of the official Eclipse
update sites.

box to search for components. Pressing the
_Install_
button starts the
installation process.
