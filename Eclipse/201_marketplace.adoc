== Eclipse Marketplace

=== Using the Marketplace client 
	
Eclipse also contains a client which allows installing software components from the Eclipse _Marketplace client_. 
The advantage of this client is that you can search for components, discover popular extensions and see descriptions and ratings.
	
Compared to the update manager, you do not have to know the URL for the _software site_ which contains the installable software components.
	
Most Eclipse distributions contain the _Marketplace client_ by default. 
You may need to install the _Marketplace client_ software component into Eclipse before you can use it. 
The following screenshot shows how to install it from one of the official Eclipse update sites, via the menu:Help[Install New Software...] dialog.

You can use the _Find_ box to search for components. 
Pressing the btn:[Install] button starts the installation process.
