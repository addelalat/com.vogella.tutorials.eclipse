		Eclipse also contains a client which allows installing software
		components from the Eclipse
		_Marketplace client_
		. The advantage of this client
		is
		that you can search for components,
		discover popular
		extensions and
		see descriptions and ratings.
	
	
		Compared to the update manager, you do not have to know
		the
		URL
		for
		the
		_software site_
		which contains the installable software components.
	
	
		Not all Eclipse distributions contain the
		_Marketplace client_
		by
		default. You may need to install the
		_Marketplace client_
		software component into Eclipse before you can use it. The following
		screenshot shows how to install it from one of the official Eclipse
		update sites.

		You can use the
		_Find_
		box to search for components. Pressing the
		<guibutton>Install</guibutton>
		button starts the
		installation process.
