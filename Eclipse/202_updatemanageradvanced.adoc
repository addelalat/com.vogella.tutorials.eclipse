== Advanced Eclipse Update manager options

=== Manual installation of plug-ins (dropins folder)

Eclipse plug-ins are distributed as
_jar_
files.
If you want to use an Eclipse plug-in directly or do not
know
the
_update site_
for it,
you
can place it in the
_dropins_
folder of your Eclipse installation
directory. Eclipse monitors this
directory and during a (re-)start of your IDE, the Eclipse update
manager installs
and removes plug-in based on the files contained in
this directory.

You should not modify
the content of the Eclipse
_plugins_
directory directly. If you want to install plug-ins, put them into the
_dropins_
folder. If you want to remove it, delete the JAR from this folder.

Plug-ins are typically distributed as
_jar_
files. To add a
plug-in to your Eclipse installation, put the plug-in
.jar file into
the
Eclipse
_dropins_
folder
and
restart Eclipse. Eclipse should detect
the
new
plug-in and
install it
for you.

If you remove plug-ins from the
_dropins_
folder and restart Eclipse, these plug-ins are automatically removed
from your Eclipse installation.

=== Exporting and importing the installed components

Eclipse allows you to export a file which
describes the installed
Eclipse components. During the export the user can select which
components should be included into this description file.

Other
users
can import this description
file into
their
Eclipse
installation and
install the components based on this file.

This way, Eclipse installation can be kept in sync with each
other.

To export a description file, select
menu:File[Export > Install > Installed Software Items to File]
and select the components which should be included in your
description file.

To install the described components in another Eclipse
installation,
open the exported file with
menu:File[Import > Install > Install Software Items from File]
and follow the wizard. The wizard allows you to specify the
components which should be installed.

=== Installing features via the command line

The Eclipse update manager has a component called
_director_
which allows you to
install new features
via the command line.

For example, the following command will install the components EGit,
Mylyn and EMF into
an Eclipse instance. You need to start this command
in the command line and it assumes that you are in a directory which
contains your Eclipse installation in a folder called
_eclipse_.

The feature names which you need for this operation can be seen
on the second page of the standard installation dialog of the Eclipse
update manager.
