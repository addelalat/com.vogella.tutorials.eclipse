=== Manual installation of plug-ins (dropins folder)

			<primary>Update manager</primary>
			<secondary>dropins folder
			</secondary>
		</indexterm>

		
			Eclipse plug-ins are distributed as
			<filename>jar</filename>
			files.
			If you want to use an Eclipse plug-in directly or do not
			know
			the
			_update
				site
			_
			for it,
			you
			can place it in the
			<filename>dropins</filename>
			folder of your Eclipse installation
			directory. Eclipse monitors this
			directory and during a (re-)start of your IDE, the Eclipse update
			manager installs
			and removes plug-in based on the files contained in
			this directory.
		
		
			You should not modify
			the content of the Eclipse
			<filename>plugins</filename>
			directory directly. If you want to install plug-ins, put them into the
			<filename>dropins</filename>
			folder. If you want to remove it, delete the JAR from this folder.
		
		
			Plug-ins are typically distributed as
			<filename>jar</filename>
			files. To add a
			plug-in to your Eclipse installation, put the plug-in
			.jar file into
			the
			Eclipse
			<filename>dropins</filename>
			folder
			and
			restart Eclipse. Eclipse should detect
			the
			new
			plug-in and
			install it
			for you.
		
		
			If you remove plug-ins from the
			<filename>dropins</filename>
			folder and restart Eclipse, these plug-ins are automatically removed
			from your Eclipse installation.

		</indexterm>
		Eclipse allows you to export a file which
			describes the installed
			Eclipse components. During the export the user can select which
			components should be included into this description file.
		
		
			Other
			users
			can import this description
			file into
			their
			Eclipse
			installation and
			install the components based on this file.
		
		This way, Eclipse installation can be kept in sync with each
			other.
		
		
			To export a description file, select
			menu:File[Export > Install > Installed Software Items to File]
			and select the components which should be included in your
			description file.

			To install the described components in another Eclipse
			installation,
			open the exported file with
			menu:File[Import > Install > Install Software Items from File]
			and follow the wizard. The wizard allows you to specify the
			components which should be installed.

=== Installing features via the command line

		</indexterm>
		
			The Eclipse update manager has a component called
			_director_
			which allows you to
			install new features
			via the command line.
		
		
			For example, the following command will install the components EGit,
			Mylyn and EMF into
			an Eclipse instance. You need to start this command
			in the command line and it assumes that you are in a directory which
			contains your Eclipse installation in a folder called
			<filename>eclipse</filename>
			.

			</programlisting>
		
		The feature names which you need for this operation can be seen
			on the second page of the standard installation dialog of the Eclipse
			update manager.
