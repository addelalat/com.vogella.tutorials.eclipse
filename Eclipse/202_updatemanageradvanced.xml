			Eclipse plug-ins are distributed as
			<filename>jar</filename>
			files.
			If you want to use an Eclipse plug-in directly or do not
			know
			the
			<wordasword>update
				site
			</wordasword>
			for it,
			you
			can place it in the
			<filename>dropins</filename>
			folder of your Eclipse installation
			directory. Eclipse monitors this
			directory and during a (re-)start of your IDE, the Eclipse update
			manager installs
			and removes plug-in based on the files contained in
			this directory.
		</para>
		<para>
			You should not modify
			the content of the Eclipse
			<filename>plugins</filename>
			directory directly. If you want to install plug-ins, put them into the
			<filename>dropins</filename>
			folder. If you want to remove it, delete the JAR from this folder.
		</para>
		<para>
			Plug-ins are typically distributed as
			<filename>jar</filename>
			files. To add a
			plug-in to your Eclipse installation, put the plug-in
			.jar file into
			the
			Eclipse
			<filename>dropins</filename>
			folder
			and
			restart Eclipse. Eclipse should detect
			the
			new
			plug-in and
			install it
			for you.
		</para>
		<para>
			If you remove plug-ins from the
			<filename>dropins</filename>
			folder and restart Eclipse, these plug-ins are automatically removed
			from your Eclipse installation.
