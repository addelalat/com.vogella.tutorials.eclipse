== Exercise: Optimizing the Eclipse IDE settings

The Eclipse IDE is relatively conservative configured to avoid surprises during development. 
Certain settings in the Eclipse IDE allow you to use it more efficiently. 
In this exercise you make changes to the default Eclipse IDE settings to your personal usability with the Eclipse IDE.

[TIP]
====
If you find a setting in this exercise not working for you, you can always skip that setting.
There is not a single correct setting for everyone in the world.
====

=== Link Java editor with the Project Explorer or Package Explorer view
		
You can synchronize the currently selected Java editor with the selection in the _Project Explorer_ or the _Package Explorer_ view. 
This gives you a clearer visibility which object you are currently editing.
		
Enable this by selecting the corresponding button in the view.

=== Automatic placement of semicolon
 
Eclipse can make typing more efficient by placing semicolons at the correct position in your source code.

In the Preference setting select menu:Java[Editor > Typing]. 
In the _Automatically insert at correct position_ selection enable the _Semicolons_ checkbox.

Afterwards, you can type a semicolon in the middle of your code and Eclipse positions it at the end of the current statement.

=== Auto-escape text pasted into Strings

Eclipse allows you to escape text automatically if it is pasted into a String literal. 
For example, you can copy HTML code and paste it into a String in your Java source.
Eclipse would escape the text automatically for you.

Activate this setting via menu:Window[Preferences > Java > Editor > Typing > In string literals > Escape text when pasting into string literal]

Now you can paste text that should be escaped.
The following code snippet shows an example for the resulting code if you paste HTML code containing a link into a string literal.

=== Bracket highlighting

You can configure Eclipse to highlight the matching brackets of a code block in the source code editor.

Before the change you would not see the enclosing brackets.
Afterwards, they will be slightly highlighted. 
This helps to see in which block you are.

=== Always start previous launched application
		
Eclipse allows you to start an application via the btn:[Run] button in the menu or via the kbd:[Ctrl+F11] shortcut. 
By default, Eclipse determines if the currently selected file is executable and try to start that. 
This is sometimes confusing.
You can configure the Eclipse IDE to always start the last started program.
		
To configure this, select menu:Window[Preferences > Run/Debug > Launching].
In the Eclipse preferences dialog select the _Launch the previously launched application_ option in the menu:Run/Debug[Launching] setting.

[[java_typefilters]]
=== Filtering out certain Java packages via Type filters

To add import statements to your code, you can use the _Organize Imports_ action (shortcut: kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+O]).
If there are several alternatives, Eclipse suggests all available packages and the user has to select the right one.

[TIP]
====
The _Save Actions_ setting can automatically organize import statements.
It adds import statements automatically if there is only one possible import and removes unused ones.
====

The following shows the available packages for the `List` class in the _Organize Imports_ dialog.

If you never use certain packages, for example AWT or Swing, you can exclude these packages from Eclipse via the menu:Window[Preferences > Java > Appearance > Type Filters] setting.

Press the btn:[Add packages] button to add a specific package or the btn:[Add...] button to use wildcards. 
The setting in the following screenshot excludes the `java.awt` and `java.swing` packages from the possible imports and other Java search functionality.

[TIP]
====
Please note that Eclipse shows (in its default configuration) only the packages that are used in the current workspace. 
If you want to exclude standard Java packages, you have to create at least one Java project.
====
	
=== Format source code, organize imports and code cleanup on save

Eclipse can perform actions during the save operation (shortcut: kbd:[Ctrl+S])., e.g., format your source code, organize your imports can cleanup your code.
You can find the corresponding settings under menu:Window[Preferences>Java>Editor > Save Actions].

Select that the source code should be formated and that the imports should be  organized at every save action.
		
image::exercise_saveactions11.png[Activating Save Actions,pdfwidth=30%]

[TIP]
====
Import statements are only automatically created if where is one valid import. 
If Eclipse determines more than one valid import, it will not add import statements automatically. 
In this case you still need to right-click in your editor and select menu:Source[Organize Imports] (shortcut: kbd:[Shift+Ctrl+O]).

You can improve this with <<java_typefilters>>, as this reduces the list of possible imports.
====

You can also define the additional actions which are performed during save.
Via the btn:[Configure...] button you can select which one you want to activate.

=== Completion overwrites and insert guessed method arguments

Eclipse can override existing method calls, in case you trigger a code completion in an existing statement.
Eclipse can also try to guess the correct actual parameters for a method call.

image::jdt_completion04.png[JDT completion,pdfwidth=30%]

With the first setting you can override methods in the middle of a statement via the kbd:[Ctrl+Space] code assists shortcut.

Without this setting you would get the following result, which results in a syntax error.

With this setting you get the following result.

=== Auto activation key for code completion

[WARNING]
====
Due to https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=348857[Bug 348857] this setting is not usable at the moment.
====

The Eclipse IDE is configured to give you automatic code completion suggestion only after the . sign. 
YOu can configure Eclipse to get code completion on every character. 
Open again the menu:Window[Preferences > Java > Editor > Content Assists] preference setting and enter  .abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVXYZ in the _Auto activation trigger for Java_.
