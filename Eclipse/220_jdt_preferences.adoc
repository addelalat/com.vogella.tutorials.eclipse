== Exercise: Configuring the IDE for an improved development experience

=== Why adjusting the Eclipse default configuration?

The Eclipse IDE is relatively conservative configured to avoid
surprises during development. Certain settings in
the Eclipse IDE allow you to use it
more
efficiently. In this exercise you
make changes to
the default Eclipse
IDE
settings to your personal usability with the
Eclipse IDE. If you find a setting in this exercise not working for you,
you
can always skip
that setting.

=== Link Java editor with the Package Explorer view

You can synchronize the currently selected
Java editor with the
selection in the
_Package Explorer_
view. This gives you a clearer visibility which object you are
currently
editing.

Enable this by selecting the corresponding button in the
_Package Explorer_
view.

=== Automatic placement of semicolon
 
Eclipse can make typing more efficient by placing semicolons
at
the correct position in your source code.

In the Preference setting select
menu:Java[Editor > Typing]
. In the
_Automatically insert at correct position_
selection
enable
the
_Semicolons_
checkbox.

Afterwards, you can type a semicolon in the middle of your code
and
Eclipse will position it at the end of the
current statement.

=== Auto-escape text pasted into Strings

Eclipse allows you to escape text automatically if it is pasted
into
a String literal. For example, you can copy
HTML code and paste
it
into
a String in your Java source. Eclipse would escape the text
automatically for you.

Activate this setting via
menu:Window[Preferences > Java > Editor > Typing > In string literals > Escape text when pasting into string literal]

Now you can paste text that should be escaped. The
following code
snippet shows an example for the resulting code
if you
paste
HTML code
containing a link into a string literal.

<[source,java]
----
include::res/escape/Paste1.txt[]
----

=== Bracket highlighting

You can configure Eclipse to highlight the matching brackets of
a code block in the source code editor.

Before the change you would not see the enclosing brackets.
Afterwards, they will be slightly highlighted. This
helps to see in
which block you are.

=== Code cleanup during save via save actions

Eclipse can cleanup your code and format it automatically during save (shortcut:
kbd:[Ctrl+S]
).
You can find
the corresponding
settings under
menu:Window[Preferences+Java[Editor > Save Actions].

Here you can define the actions which should be performed during save and via the
_Configure..._
button you can configure the code cleanup actions which should be performed.

Import statements are only automatically created if
where is one valid import. If Eclipse determines more
than
one valid
import, it will not add import statements automatically. In this case
you still need to right-click in
your editor and
select
menu:Source[Organize Imports]
(shortcut:
kbd:[Shift+Ctrl+O]).

=== Launch configuration

In the Eclipse preferences dialog select the
_Launch the previously launched application_
option in the
menu:Run/Debug[Launching]
setting.

=== Type Filters

The
_Save Actions_
setting
automatically adds required import statements to your source
code
if there is only one possible import.

Alternatively, or if there are several possible imports, you can use
the
_Organize Imports_ (shortcut:
kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+O]
).
If
there are several
alternatives, Eclipse
suggests all available
packages and
the user has
to
select the right
one.

The following shows the available packages for the
`List`
class in the
_Organize Imports_
dialog.

If you never use certain packages, for example AWT or Swing, you can
exclude
these packages from Eclipse via the
menu:Window[Preferences > Java > Appearance > Type Filters]
setting.

Press the
_Add packages_
button
to add a specific package or the
_Add..._
button
to use
wildcards. The setting in the following screenshot
excludes all
AWT packages from the
possible imports and
other Java
search
functionality
in Eclipse.

Please note that Eclipse shows (in its default configuration)
only the packages that are
used in the current
workspace. If you want
to exclude standard Java
packages, you have to create at least one
Java
project.

=== Completion overwrites and insert guessed method arguments

Eclipse can override existing method calls, in case you trigger
a code completion in an existing statement.
Eclipse can also try to
guess
the correct actual
parameters for a method call.

image::jdt_completion04.png[JDT completion,pdfwidth=30%,width=30%]

With the first setting you can override methods in the middle of
a
statement via the
kbd:[Ctrl+Space]
code assists shortcut.

image::jdt_completion08.png[Trigger code completion]

Without this setting you would get the following result, which
results in a syntax error.

With this setting you get the following result.

=== Auto activation key for code completion

The Eclipse IDE is configured to give you automatic code completion
suggestion only after the . sign. Typically you
want to have code
completion on every character. Open again the
menu:Window[Preferences > Java > Editor > Content Assists]
preference setting and enter
.abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVXYZ in the
_Auto activation trigger for Java_.
