== Eclipse code checks and cleanup

=== Java Development Toolkit code checks
		
You can define how the Java compiler should react to certain
common
programming problems, e.g., you can define that an assignment
of a
variable which
has no effect, e.g.,
`x=x`
, causes an error in
Eclipse.

=== Configuring the code settings
		
You can configure these checks in the Eclipse preferences
settings via
the
menu:Java[Compiler > Errors/Warnings]
entry.

=== Annotation-based Null analysis
		
You can enable annotation-based null checks in Eclipse via the
setting highlighted in the following screenshot.

After enabling this setting, you can use the
`@NonNull`
annotation on method parameters or variable definitions to indicate
that these are not allowed to be NULL. You can also use the
`@Nullable`
annotation to define that a variable can be NULL.

=== Running a code cleanup and removal of trailing whitespace
		
Eclipse has the option to perform cleanup actions on existing
code. This includes the removal of trailing whitespace, the
additional of missing annotations but also advanced cleanups like the
conversion of code to Java
8 lambda expressions.
		
To trigger this cleanup, select the Java source file, package or
project and select
menu:Source[Clean-up...]
from the context menu.

WARNING: Ensure to unselect any cleanup action which you do not want to perform.
		
After finishing the configuration, press
_OK_
and the
_Next_
button in the cleanup wizard to get a preview of the changes.
