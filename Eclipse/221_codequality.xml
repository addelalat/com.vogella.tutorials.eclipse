			You can define how the Java compiler should react to certain
			common
			programming problems, e.g., you can define that an assignment
			of a
			variable which
			has no effect, e.g.,
			<code>x=x</code>
			, causes an error in
			Eclipse.
		
	
[[codequality_settings">
=== Configuring the code settings

		
			You can configure these checks in the Eclipse preferences
			settings via
			the
			menu:Java[Compiler > Errors/Warnings]
			entry.

			After enabling this setting, you can use the
			<code>@NonNull</code>
			annotation on method parameters or variable definitions to indicate
			that these are not allowed to be NULL. You can also use the
			<code>@Nullable</code>
			annotation to define that a variable can be NULL.
		
	

[[codequality_codeclean">
=== Running a code cleanup and removal of trailing whitespace
		
		Eclipse has the option to perform cleanup actions on existing
			code. This includes the removal of trailing whitespace, the
			additional of missing annotations but also advanced cleanups like the
			conversion of code to Java
			8 lambda expressions.
		

		
			To trigger this cleanup, select the Java source file, package or
			project and select
			menu:Source[Clean-up...]
			from the context menu.

			to configure the actions which should be performed on your code.
