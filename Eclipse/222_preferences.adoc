== More on preference settings


This chapter lists other useful Eclipse settings which are not directly related to Java development.
It also explains how to export and import your preference settings from one workspace to another.

=== Launch Configuration
		
Eclipse allows you to start an application via the btn:[Run] button in the menu or via the kbd:[Ctrl+F11] shortcut. 
By default, Eclipse determines if the currently selected file is executable and try to start that. 
This is sometimes confusing.
You can configure the Eclipse IDE to always start the last started program.
		
To configure this, select menu:Window[Preferences > Run/Debug > Launching].
Define that the previous launched application should always be launched.

=== Configuring the editors for a file extension
		
The _Editors_ which are available to open a file can be configured via menu:Window[Preferences > General > Editors > File Associations].
		
The btn:[Default] button in this preference dialog allows you to set the default editor for a certain file extension.
This edit is used by default, if you open a new file with this extension.
		
The other configured _editors_ can be selected if you right-click on a file and by selecting menu:Open With[].
In the sub-menu you see the available editors. 
The available editors depend on your Eclipse installation.

Eclipse remembers the last _editor_ used to open a file. 
It uses this _editor_ again the next time you open the file.

=== Export and import preference settings
		
You can export your preference settings from one workspace via menu:File[Export > General > Preferences].
		
Eclipse does allow you to export some preference settings separately, but for most of them you have to select the _Export all_ flag.

Similarly, you can import them again into another workspace via menu:File[Import > General > Preferences].

=== Preference settings per project
		
You can also configure certain preference settings on a per project basis. 
To do this, select your project, right-click on it and select _Properties_. 
For example, on the menu:Java Editor[Save Actions] you can select the _Enable project specific settings_ checkbox to configure the save action for the current project only.

This creates a _.settings_ folder.
You can add this folder to your version control system to ensure that every developer uses the same setting.
