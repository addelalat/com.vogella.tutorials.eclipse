== More on preference settings

=== Launch Configuration
		
Eclipse allows you to start an application via the
_Run_
button in the menu or via the
kbd:[Ctrl+F11]
shortcut. By default, Eclipse determines if the currently selected
file is executable and try to start that. This is sometimes confusing.
You can configure the Eclipse IDE to always start the last started
program.
		
To configure this, select
menu:Window[Preferences > Run/Debug > Launching]
and define that the previous launched application should always be
launched.

=== Configuring the editors for a file extension
		
The
_Editors_
which are available to open a file can be configured via
menu:Window[Preferences > General > Editors > File Associations].
		
The
_Default_
button in this preference dialog allows you to set the default
editor for
a certain file extension, e.g., this is the
_editor_
which will be used
by default if you open a new file with
this
extension.
		
The other configured
_editors_
can be selected if you right-click on a file and select
menu:Open With[]
In the sub-menu you see the available editors. The available
editors
depend on your Eclipse installation.

Eclipse will remember the last
_editor_
you used to open a
file and use this
_editor_
again the next time you open the file.

=== Export and import preference settings
		
You can export your preference settings from one workspace
via
menu:File[Export > General > Preferences]
.
		
Eclipse does allow you to export some preference settings
separately, but
for
most of
them you have to select the
_Export all_
flag.

Similarly, you can import
them
again into another
workspace via
menu:File[Import > General > Preferences]
.

=== Preference settings per project
		
You can also configure certain preference settings on a per project
basis. To do this, select your project, right-click on it and select
_Properties_. For example, on the
menu:Java Editor[Save Actions]
you can select the
_Enable project specific settings_
checkbox to configure the save action for the current project only.

This creates a
_.settings_
folder which you can add to your version control system to ensure
that every developer uses the same setting.
