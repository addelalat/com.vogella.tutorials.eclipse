=== Launch Configuration
		<indexterm>
			<primary>Preferences</primary>
			<secondary>launch previous launched application
			</secondary>
		</indexterm>
		
			Eclipse allows you to start an application via the
			_Run_
			button in the menu or via the
			<keycombo>
				<keycap>Ctrl</keycap>
				<keycap>F11</keycap>
			</keycombo>
			shortcut. By default, Eclipse determines if the currently selected
			file is executable and try to start that. This is sometimes confusing.
			You can configure the Eclipse IDE to always start the last started
			program.
		
		
			To configure this, select
			menu:Window[Preferences > Run/Debug > Launching]
			and define that the previous launched application should always be
			launched.

=== Configuring the editors for a file extension
		<indexterm>
			<primary>Preferences</primary>
			<secondary>configure editor for given file extension
			</secondary>
		</indexterm>
		
			The
			_Editors_
			which are available to open a file can be configured via
			menu:Window
				[Preferences > General > Editors > File Associations]
			.
		
		
			The
			_Default_
			button in this preference dialog allows you to set the default
			editor for
			a certain file extension, e.g., this is the
			_editor_
			which will be used
			by default if you open a new file with
			this
			extension.
		
		
			The other configured
			_editors_
			can be selected if you right-click on a file and select
			menu:Open With</guimenu>
			</menuchoice>
			In the sub-menu you see the available editors. The available
			editors
			depend on your Eclipse installation.

			Eclipse will remember the last
			_editor_
			you used to open a
			file and use this
			_editor_
			again the next time you open the file.
		

	


=== Export and import preference settings
		<indexterm>
			<primary>Preferences</primary>
			<secondary>export and import preferences
			</secondary>
		</indexterm>
		
			You can export your preference settings from one workspace
			via
			menu:File[Export > General > Preferences]
			.

		
		
			Eclipse does allow you to export some preference settings
			separately, but
			for
			most of
			them you have to select the
			_Export all_
			flag.

			Similarly, you can import
			them
			again into another
			workspace via
			menu:File[Import > General > Preferences]
			.
		

	

=== Preference settings per project
		<indexterm>
			<primary>Preferences</primary>
			<secondary>settings per project
			</secondary>
		</indexterm>
		
			You can also configure certain preference settings on a per project
			basis. To do this, select your project, right-click on it and select
			_Properties_
			. For example, on the
			menu:Java Editor[Save Actions ]
			you can select the
			_Enable project specific settings_
			checkbox to configure the save action for the current project only.

			This creates a
			_.settings_
			folder which you can add to your version control system to ensure
			that every developer uses the same setting.
