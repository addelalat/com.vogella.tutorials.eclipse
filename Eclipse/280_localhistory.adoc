== Local history for files

=== Local history

Eclipse keeps a local history of files which have changed.
Every time an editable file is saved, the Eclipse
runtime
updates the
local history of that file and logs the changes
that have 
been made.
This local history can then be accessed and used to
revert the file
changes or to compare against a previous version.

=== Compare files based on local history

To compare the current version of a file with a local version stored
by
Eclipse, right-click on the file and select
menu:Compare With[Local History...]
from the context menu. Eclipse opens the
_History_ view.

 If you double-click on an older version of the file, the
_Compare_
view
shows the differences as depicted in the following screenshot.

You can replace files based on the local history. Right-click on
the
file and select
menu:Replace With[Local history...]
to start this action.
