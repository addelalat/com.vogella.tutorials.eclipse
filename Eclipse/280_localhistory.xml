[[localhistory_overview">
=== Local history
		Eclipse keeps a local history of files which have changed.
			Every time an editable file is saved, the Eclipse
			runtime
			updates the
			local history of that file and logs the changes
			that have 
			been made.
			This local history can then be accessed and used to
			revert the file
			changes or to compare against a previous version.
		
	
[[localhistory_compare">
=== Compare files based on local history
		
			To compare the current version of a file with a local version stored
			by
			Eclipse, right-click on the file and select
			menu:Compare With[Local History...]
			from the context menu. Eclipse opens the
			_History_ view.
		
		
			 If you double-click on an older version of the file, the
			_Compare_
			view
			shows the differences as depicted in the following screenshot.
