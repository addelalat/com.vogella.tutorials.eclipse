		<title>Local history</title>
		<para>Eclipse keeps a local history of files which have changed.
			Every time an editable file is saved, the Eclipse
			runtime
			updates the
			local history of that file and logs the changes
			that have 
			been made.
			This local history can then be accessed and used to
			revert the file
			changes or to compare against a previous version.
