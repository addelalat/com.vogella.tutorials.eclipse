== Organizing your workspace with working sets


You will create more and more projects in your development career. 
Therefore, the data in your workspace grows and it is hard to find the right information.
The Eclipse IDE allows you to organize your project into _working sets_ so that you can hide certain resources. 

You can use working sets to organize your displayed projects / data.
To set up your working set, select the menu:Package Explorer[open the drop-down menu > Select Working Set...]
