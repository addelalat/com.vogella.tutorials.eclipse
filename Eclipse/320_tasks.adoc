== Tasks

=== Task management

You can place markers in the code which you can later access via the _Task_ view.

You can use
`// TODO`,
`// FIXME`
or
`// XXX`
tags in your code to add task reminders.

This indicates a task for
Eclipse. You find those in the
_Task_
view
of Eclipse. Via double-clicking on the task, you can navigate to the
corresponding code.

You can open this
view
via
menu:Window[Show View > Tasks].

For example, add a TODO to your
`MyFirstClass`
class to see it in the Tasks
view.

[source,java]
----
include::res/todo/MyFirstClass.java[]
----

Close the editor for the
`MyFirstClass`
class. If you now double-click on the
tasks, the Java editor opens
again and
the TODO comment is selected.

TIP:The _Task_ view shows only the tasks from the currently open projects. 

=== Own tags

You can also define your own tags in the Eclipse preferences via
menu:Window[Preferences > Java > Compiler > Task Tags].
