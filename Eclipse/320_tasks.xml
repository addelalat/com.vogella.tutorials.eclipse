== Tasks

=== Task management
		
		
			You can place
			markers in the
			code which you can later access via the
			_Task_
			view
			.
		
		
			You can use
			`// TODO`
			,
			`// FIXME`
			or
			`// XXX`
			tags in your code to add task reminders.
		
		
			This indicates a task for
			Eclipse. You find those in the
			_Task_
			view
			of Eclipse. Via double-clicking on the task, you can navigate to the
			corresponding code.
		
		
			You can open this
			view
			via
			menu:Window[Show View > Tasks]
			.
		
		
			For example, add a TODO to your
			`MyFirstClass`
			class to see it in the Tasks
			view
			.
		
		
			<programlisting>
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="../examples/todo/MyFirstClass.java" />
			</programlisting>
		
		
			Close the editor for the
			`MyFirstClass`
			class. If you now double-click on the
			tasks, the Java editor opens
			again and
			the TODO comment is selected.

=== Own tags
		
			You can also define your own tags in the Eclipse preferences via
