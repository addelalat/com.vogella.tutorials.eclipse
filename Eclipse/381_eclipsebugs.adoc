== Eclipse bug reports and feature requests

=== Reporting bugs and feature requests

If you encounter a problem with the Eclipse IDE or think about a potential improvement for it, you should report this
to the Eclipse project.
The Eclipse bug and feature tracker is using the open source
_Bugzilla_
project
from
_Mozilla_
. In this system, you enter Eclipse error reports. You can also request new
features or improvements
of
existing
features.

TIP: Most Eclipse projects receive lots of bug and feature requests. So if you want something fixed or
enhanced you
may have to provide a Gerrit review for it. If the Eclipse developer sees that you try to fix the
problem yourself,
you typically receive more support from them.

=== Using the Eclipse bugzilla system

This
bug tracker can be
found under
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/ - Eclipse Bugzilla
.
Here you
can
search for
existing bugs and review them.

To participate actively in the Eclipse bug tracker, you need to
create
a
new account. This can be done by clicking
the
_Create a New Account_
link.

Once you have a user account, you can login to the Eclipse
bug
tracker.
This
allows you to comment on existing bugs
and
report
new
ones.
The user data for the all Eclipse sites are the same, i.e, the
forum, marketplace, bug tracker, etc.
Only for the Gerrit access,
different user data is used.

As example you can report bugs for the Eclipse
platform via the
following link:
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/enter_bug.cgi?product=Platform - 
Bug report for the Eclipse platform.

=== Eclipse bug priorities

The Eclipse Bugzilla system allows you and the Eclipse committer
to
enter the bug priority. But overall, it is up to
each project do
decide how they handle bugs so some variation from project
to
project
will occur. The following rules can
be used as guideline.

.Bug priorities
|===
|Priority |Description
|blocker
|The bug blocks development or testing of the build and no workaround is known.

|critical
|Implies "loss of data" or frequent crashes or a severe memory leak.

|major
|Implies a "major loss of function".

|normal
|This is the default value for new bug reports. 
Implies some loss of functionality under specific circumstances, typically the correct setting unless one of the other levels fit.

|minor
|Something is wrong, but doesn't affect function significantly or other problem where easy workaround is present.

|trivial
|This describes a cosmetic problem like misspelled words or misaligned text, but doesn't affect function.

|enhancement
|Represents a request for enhancement (also for "major" features that would be really nice to have).
