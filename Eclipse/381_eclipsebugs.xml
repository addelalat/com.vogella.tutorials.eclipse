		<title>Reporting bugs and feature requests</title>

		<para>
			If you encounter a problem with the Eclipse IDE or think about a potential improvement for it, you should report this
			to the Eclipse project.
			The Eclipse bug and feature tracker is using the open source
			<wordasword>Bugzilla</wordasword>
			project
			from
			<wordasword>Mozilla</wordasword>
			. In this system, you enter Eclipse error reports. You can also request new
			features or improvements
			of
			existing
			features.
		</para>
		<tip>
			<para>Most Eclipse projects receive lots of bug and feature requests. So if you want something fixed or
				enhanced you
				may have to provide a Gerrit review for it. If the Eclipse developer sees that you try to fix the
				problem yourself,
				you typically receive more support from them.
			</para>

		<title>Eclipse bug priorities</title>
		<para>
			The Eclipse Bugzilla system allows you and the Eclipse committer
			to
			enter the bug priority. But overall, it is up to
			each project do
			decide how they handle bugs so some variation from project
			to
			project
			will occur. The following rules can
			be used as guideline.
			<table frame='all'>
				<title>Bug priorities</title>
