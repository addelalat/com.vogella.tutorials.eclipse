=== Reporting bugs and feature requests

		
			If you encounter a problem with the Eclipse IDE or think about a potential improvement for it, you should report this
			to the Eclipse project.
			The Eclipse bug and feature tracker is using the open source
			_Bugzilla_
			project
			from
			_Mozilla_
			. In this system, you enter Eclipse error reports. You can also request new
			features or improvements
			of
			existing
			features.
		
		<tip>
			Most Eclipse projects receive lots of bug and feature requests. So if you want something fixed or
				enhanced you
				may have to provide a Gerrit review for it. If the Eclipse developer sees that you try to fix the
				problem yourself,
				you typically receive more support from them.

=== Using the Eclipse bugzilla system
		
			This
			bug tracker can be
			found under
			https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/">Eclipse Bugzilla
			.
			Here you
			can
			search for
			existing bugs and review them.
		
		
			To participate actively in the Eclipse bug tracker, you need to
			create
			a
			new account. This can be done by clicking
			the
			_Create a New Account_
			link.

		 Once you have a user account, you can login to the Eclipse
			bug
			tracker.
			This
			allows you to comment on existing bugs
			and
			report
			new
			ones.
			The user data for the all Eclipse sites are the same, i.e, the
			forum, marketplace, bug tracker, etc.
			Only for the Gerrit access,
			different user data is used.
		
		
			As example you can report bugs for the Eclipse
			platform via the
			following link:
			https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/enter_bug.cgi?product=Platform">
				Bug report for the Eclipse platform
			
			.
		

	

[[eclipsebugs_priorities">
=== Eclipse bug priorities
		
			The Eclipse Bugzilla system allows you and the Eclipse committer
			to
			enter the bug priority. But overall, it is up to
			each project do
			decide how they handle bugs so some variation from project
			to
			project
			will occur. The following rules can
			be used as guideline.

						<row>
							<entry>trivial</entry>
							<entry>This describes a cosmetic problem like misspelled words or
								misaligned text, but doesn't affect function.
							</entry>
						</row>
						<row>
							<entry>enhancement</entry>
							<entry>Represents a request for enhancement (also for "major"
