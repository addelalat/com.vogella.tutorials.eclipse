	<para> Due to the complexity and extensibility of Eclipse, you will
		need
		additional resources to help you solve your specific
		problems.
		Fortunately, the web contains several resources which can help
		you
		with
		your Eclipse problems.
	</para>
	<para>
		Currently, the best places to find, ask and answer questions are the
		<ulink url="http://eclipse.org/forums">Eclipse forums</ulink>
		and
		<ulink url="http://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</ulink>
		. 
		Try
		to stay polite with your postings, as the Eclipse community values
		polite behavior.
	</para>
	<para>
		The
		<wordasword>Eclipse
			forums
		</wordasword>
		offer several topic-specific forums in which
		you can post and answer
		questions. To post or to answer questions in the Eclipse
		forums, you
		need a valid
		user account in the Eclipse bug tracker. The advantage
		of
		the Eclipse
		forums is
		that, depending on the topic, developers of
		Eclipse projects
		(
		<wordasword>Eclipse committers</wordasword>
		)
		are also
		active there
		and might directly answer your
		question.
	</para>
	<para>
		<wordasword>Stack Overflow</wordasword>
		also requires a user account and its community is also
		very
		active.
		<wordasword>Stack Overflow</wordasword>
		does not have separate forum sections for
		specific questions.
		<wordasword>Stack Overflow</wordasword>
		allows to tag questions with
		the relevant keyword, e.g.,
		<guilabel>Eclipse</guilabel>
		and people search for them or
		subscribe to these theses.

	<note>
		<para>Ensure that you search the forums and mailing lists for
			solutions
			for your problem since often somebody else has asked the
			same
			question earlier and the answer is already available.
