== Tutorial: Adding Views to your application

=== Create a view

The
following will
explain how to add views to your
application.
We will continue to use the
RCP project
"de.vogella.rcp.intro.first".
		
Add the extension "org.eclipse.ui.views" to your plugin. Select
"_plugin.xml_ and the tab "Extentions".
Right
mouse-click on your new
view extension and select
menu:New[View].
Maintain the id
"de.vogella.rcp.intro.view.MyView" and the
class
"de.vogella.rcp.intro.view.MyView".

Create the class "MyView" by clicking on the "class"
hyperlink
and
maintain the following code. Afterwards, your view is ready to be
used.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/view/MyView.java[]
----

=== Add the view to your perspective

You have to add the view to your
perspective. Add
the extension
"org.eclipse.ui.perspectiveExtensions" to your plugin.

Right-click "*(perspectiveExtension)"
menu:New[View].
Maintain
your view id
`de.vogella.rcp.intro.first.MyView`.
Make
the view
relative
to
`org.eclipse.ui.editors`
which is the currently
invisible
editor
area
and make the view use all the space by selecting
the maximum
ratio
of
`0.95f`.

=== Result
		
Run your application to see the result.

=== Add view to perspective via code

I personally prefer extension points over code. But instead of
using the extension
point
"org.eclipse.ui.perspectiveExtensions" you
could also add the
view
via
code to the perspective. For this modify
"Perspective.java" to the following.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/view/Perspective.java[]
