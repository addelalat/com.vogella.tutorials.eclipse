== Tutorial: Adding an Perspectives

Create a new RCP project called
"de.vogella.rcp.intro.perspective". Use the "RCP application with a
view" as a template. In _plugin.xml_ add a new extension point
"org.eclipse.ui.perspectives". Give the perspective with the id
"de.vogella.rcp.intro.perspective.perspective" and the name
"vogella.com Perspective". Change the class name to
"de.vogella.rcp.intro.perspective.Perspective".

Click on the "class*" link to create the class. The 
`createInitialLayout()` method in your new class is
responsible for creating the
new perspective. We reuse the existing
view in the coding. After this
step the perspective is defined but
not yet reachable via the
application.

After defining your perspective you also need to enable your
application so that the user can select this perspective.
	
One alternative is to allow the user to select the
perspective
via the
toolbar / coolbar. You can activate the switch between
perspectives the
ApplicationWorkbenchWindowAdvisor in method
preWindowOpen() with
configurer.setShowPerspectiveBar(true);

You should now be able to select your perspective
interactively.

In addition you could reuse the Eclipse command
"org.eclipse.ui.perspectives.showPerspective" which allows to switch
between perspectives.
