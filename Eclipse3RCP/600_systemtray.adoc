== Tutorial: System Tray

The following add an icon for the RCP application to the system
tray and adds a menu to this icon. We add the functionality that if
the window is minimized
then the program is not visible in the taskpane
(only via the tray
icon).

Create a new project "de.vogella.rcp.intro.traytest". Use the
"Hello RCP" as a template. Open the class
"ApplicationWorkbenchWindowAdvisor" and maintain
the following code.
	
[source,java]
----
include::res/systemtray/ApplicationWorkbenchWindowAdvisor.java[]
----
	
Run your application and see that you have a system tray icon.
Test the menu and the minimized behavior. If the application is
minimized it should not be visible in the taskbar but only in the
system
tray.
