== Reading resources from plug-ins
	
You can access files in your plug-in via two different
approaches: via
the
`FileLocator`
class or via an Eclipse specific URL. Both approaches require
that your
plug-in defines a dependency to the
`org.eclipse.core.runtime`
plug-in.
	
	
Both approaches return a URL which can be used to get an
`InputStream`.
	
The following code shows an example with
`FileLocator`.

[source,java]
----
include::res/resource/readFileLocator.java[]
----
	
The following code shows an example for the usage of the
Eclipse
specific URL.

[source,java]
----
include::res/resource/readURL.java[]
----
	
Using the URL to create an
`InputStream`
and to read the file is demonstrated in the next code example.
