	<title>What are Extension Points?
	
		Extension-points define
		interfaces for other
		plug-ins to contribute
		functionality (code and
		non-code).
	
	
		They are defined in the <filename>plugin.xml</filename> file, which must be
		in
		the root directory of
		your plug-in project.
	

	
		Existing extensions (contributions) are collected during the
		start of an Eclipse
		application.
