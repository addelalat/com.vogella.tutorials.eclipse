== Main components of an Eclipse RCP application
	 The minimal required plug-ins to create and run an
		minimal
		Eclipse RCP
		application (with UI) are the two plugins
		"org.eclipse.core.runtime"
		and
		"org.eclipse.ui". Based on these
		components an Eclipse RCP application must define the following
		elements:
	
	
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				Main program - A RCP main application class implements
					the
					interface "IApplication". This class can be
					viewed as the
					equivalent
					to the main method for standard Java
					application. Eclipse
					expects
					that the application
					class
					is defined
					via the extension point
					"org.eclipse.core.runtime.application".
				
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				A Perspective - defines the layout of your application. Must
					be declared via the extension point
					"org.eclipse.ui.perspective".
				
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				Workbench Advisor- invisible technical component
					which
					controls
					the appearance of the application (menus, toolbars,
					perspectives,
					etc)
				
			</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
	
	
		The Eclipse application is the equivalent of the Java
		`main()`
		method. Applications are defined via the extension point
		`org.eclipse.core.runtime.applications`
		and must extend
		`IApplication`
		.
