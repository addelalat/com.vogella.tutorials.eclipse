	<title>Approach</title>
	<para>If you teach programming you basically have two extreme choices.
		The
		first approach is that you
		explain everything first and then do it.
		The
		second choice is that you first do everything and then explain what
		you
		have done.
	</para>
	<para>The following description tends towards the second approach.
	</para>
	<para>
		We will develop
		a small RCP application, create a product and
		launch it,
		before
		explaining the project structure, the involved classes
		and what a
		product
		or a launch configuration is.
	</para>

	<para> In my experience its easier to understand an explanation, if you
		have already created an example.
	</para>
	<para>
		The risk associated with that
		approach is that if you run into a
		problem you do not know how to solve
		it.
	</para>
	<para> Therefore if you
		have problem starting your product, I suggest to
		read
		the chapter about
		launch configurations and if that does not help,
		check the "Products and Branding"
		chapter.
	</para>
