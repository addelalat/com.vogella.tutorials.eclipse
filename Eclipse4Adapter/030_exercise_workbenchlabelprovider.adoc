== Exercise - Adapters for the IWorkbenchAdapter

The `IWorkbenchAdapter` interface is used enable any object to be visualized in the workspace, e.g., in the Package Explorer or the Project Explorer.

So it provides a label and image for a label provider, e.g., the `WorkbenchLabelProvider`, which is supposed to visualize the object. And a `getParent()` and `getChildren()` method to be used in an `ITreeContentProvider`, e.g., the `WorkbenchContentProvider`.

=== Creating a model object

For this exercise a `Todo` object should be created and is supposed to be adapted as IWorkbenchAdapter.

=== Solution by implementing IAdaptable

One solution could be letting the `Todo` directly implement `IAdaptable` and return the desired `IWorkbenchAdapter`.

include::res/model/AdaptableTodo.java[]
----

<1> The `getLabel()` will be used by the `WorkbenchLabelProvider` to get a label for the Todo, even though it does not know the type `Todo`, which can be considered as inversion of control and loose coupling.

=== Making use of the WorkbenchLabelProvider

Using the `WorkbenchLabelProvider` for a `Viewer` makes it possible to view any kind of object in the `Viewer` as long as it supplies an adapter of type `IWorkbenchAdapter`.

So what the `WorkbenchLabelProvider` does is to ask the adapter framework for each object, which is supposed to be shown in the `Viewer` whether there is an adapter of type `IWorkbenchAdapter` for that object.

<1> `WorkbenchLabelProvider`, which does not know anything about `Todo` objects.

So the `WorkbenchLabelProvider` does not know anything about `Todo` objects, but will nevertheless be able to show them due to the fact, that the `WorkbenchLabelProvider` is able to get an instance of an `IWorkbenchAdapter` for `Todo` objects.

=== Also show a Task object from a third party vendor

Since the `WorkbenchLabelProvider` can handle any type of objects as long as they can be adapted to an `IWorkbenchAdapter`, a Task object from a third party vendor could also be shown.

The problem here is that classes from third party vendors cannot be changed and therefore the `IAdaptable` interface cannot be implemented.

But an `IAdapterFactory` can be registered to provide adapters for such a `Task` object.

So for testing purpose the `Todo` class without implementing the `IAdaptable` interface can be copied and renamed to `Task`.

To provide the `IWorkbenchAdapter` as adapter for the `Task` object the _org.eclipse.core.runtime.adapters_ extension point must be used.

In plain XML it looks like this:

The `IAdapterFactory` for `Task` objects should look like this.
