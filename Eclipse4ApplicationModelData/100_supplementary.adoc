== Persisted model attributes

=== Adding additional information on the model elements

The
_Supplementary_
tab in the application model editor allows you to enter additional
information
about the selected
model element. This data can also be
modified and accessed via Eclipse API.

=== Tags

All model elements can have
_tags_
assigned to them.
These
tags
can be used by the Eclipse platform or by
other code to trigger
functionality.

Tags
are automatically persisted by the Eclipse runtime between
application restarts and are
represented as a
`List`
of type
`String`
.

[TIP]
==== 
Tags are also available to the CSS Engine as additional class
selectors.
For
example, the currently active part is tagged as
_active_
at runtime
and the CSS engine allows to style components
based on
this with the
selector
`.MPartStack.active`
. If you want to use tag as CSS selectors, don't use whitespace in
them.

You can define your own tags and define CSS for this. This is a
great way to allow custom CSS to be
integrated into
the
model.
====

By default, Eclipse uses some predefined
_tags_
to determine the state of certain model elements. For example, the
_shellMaximized_
and
_shellMinimized_
tag on a
_Window_
is used by Eclipse to determine if the
_Window_
should be maximized or minimized.

The following screenshot shows how to define the
maximization of a
_Window_
model element.

=== Variables

You can also define
_Variables_
in the
_Supplementary_
tab which can be used as
_context variables_
. If you use this approach, Eclipse creates keys in the context which
are marked as modifiable (by descendants).
See the Eclipse RCP tutorial 
for the concept of dependency injection.

=== Persisted state

Model elements can have persisted state key/value pairs assigned
to them. If you
retrieve the model element, you can get and set this
persisted state.

Persisted data for model elements is automatically restored by
the Eclipse
application between application restarts and allows to
store key/values pairs based on Strings.

Persisted state data can also be used by the Eclipse framework
to
define or change the application behavior.

=== Transient data

Each model element can also attach transient data to it.
This
transient data is based on a
`<![CDATA[Map<String , Object>]]>`
structure and can be accessed on the model object via the
`getTransientData()`
method.

Transient data is not persisted between application restarts and
needs to be generated at
runtime.

As transient data is not persisted, it can not be assigned to
model
elements via the application model editor, you need to use the
`getTransientData()`
method.
