== Exercise: Using model tags and persisted data

=== Target
		
In this exercise you are about to learn
how to use tags and
persisted state
data on the application model elements.
		
TIP: Use <<recipes_tags>>
	for information on the tags or look directly at the
	`IPresentationEngine`
	interface.


=== Use tags
		
Add the
_NoMove_
tag to your parts and ensure that you cannot move it via
drag and
drag.
		
		
Make all your parts closable via the corresponding model attribute.
Assign the
_NoAutoCollapse_
to a stack and close all parts in this stack. Validate that your
stack is not closed.
		
	

=== Optional: Use persisted state
		
Add to the
_styleOverride_
parameter with the value 1024 as
_Persisted State_
to on of your
_PartStacks_
model elements.
		
		This causes this part stack to render its tabs at the bottom.
