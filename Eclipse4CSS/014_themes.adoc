== Styling using themes
(((Theme service, CSS)))
(((CSS,Theming of Eclipse applications)))
(((IThemeEngine,CSS)))
(((cssTheme)))
You can define _themes_ for styling your application.
This can be done via extensions in the _plugin.xml_ file.
To create new themes you define extensions for the `org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt.theme` extension point. 
Such an extension defines an ID for the style and a pointer to the CSS file.

You can define the default theme via the `cssTheme` property in your `org.eclipse.core.runtime.products` extension. 
This can also be used to define a fixed styling.

WARNING: You need to set `cssTheme` otherwise the theming services is available at runtime.

The Eclipse platform provides the theme service with an instance of the `IThemeEngine` interface. 
Via this instance you can change the active theme at runtime.	
The switching of themes is demonstrated in the following handler code.

[NOTE]
====

You can also specify a fixed styling of your application. 
This is done via a property for the `org.eclipse.core.runtime.products` extension point in the _plugin.xml_ file.


The value of the `applicationCSS` property should point to your CSS file via an URI.
The URI follows the `platform:/plugin/BundleSymbolicName/path/file` convention. 
The following example demonstrates such a URI:

platform:/plugin/com.example.e4.rcp.todo/css/default.css

The screenshot shows an example of the _plugin.xml_ file with a defined  `applicationCSS` property.
