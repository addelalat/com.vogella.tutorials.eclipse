== CSS support for standard Eclipse elements

=== CSS attributes and selectors

The CSS attributes for SWT widgets which can be styled are listed under the following
link: http://wiki.eclipse.org/E4/CSS/SWT_Mapping

Model elements of your Eclipse application, e.g., _MPartStack_ or _MPart_ can also be used a selectors for styling. 
The CSS selectors are based on the Java classes for the model elements. 
Some examples are given in the following table.


.Table Model elements and CSS selectors
|===
|Model Element  |CSS Selector

|MPart
|.MPart

|MPartStack
|.MPartStack

|MPartSashContainer
|.MPartSashContainer

|===


For example you could hide the minimize and maximize button of a _MPartStack_ via the following CSS rule.

include::res/css/hideminimize.txt[]

Eclipse also supports _CSS pseudo classes_ but these are disabled by default. 
See https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=362532 for details.
The following table lists several of the available pseudo classes.


.Table CSS pseudo classes in Eclipse
|===
|CSS pseudo classes |Description

|Button:checked
|Selects checked buttons

|:active
|For example shell:active selects the active shell

|:selected
|Allows to style a selected element, e.g., a part in a PartStack.

=== Styling based on identifiers and classes

You can specify an _identifier_ or a _class_ on widgets in your source code and use these as selectors for styling.
An identifier is supposed to be unique while a class can be assigned to several elements.

The following example demonstrates how to set the identifier and the class on SWT widgets.

Sometimes the `IStylingEngine` cannot be accessed easily.
For example, if your want to style existing dialog which are not created via dependency injection. 
In this case you can set a tag on SWT widget directly.

include::res/css/datatag2.txt[]
----

These ids or classes can be addressed in the CSS file via the `#` or the `.` selector.

=== Colors and gradients

Colors can be defined in different ways. 
For example, the color white can be described as `white`, `rgb(255,255,255)` or `#ffffff` .

Styling supports gradients for the background color of user interface widgets. 
Linear and radial gradients are supported. 
The definition of gradients is demonstrated in the following listing.

[source,txt]
----
include::res/css/gradient.txt[]
----

If you use the optional percentage in the definition, then the color change will be done after the defined percentage. 
The following picture shows the result of different settings.

NOTE:  Please note that the current gradient specification is not compliant with the CSS specification and that it might change in the future.

=== CSS imports
(((CSS, Import statement)))

Eclipse supports also the import of existing stylesheets via the `@import` directive using the platform URI notation.
If you import CSS files from another plug-in, it  requires that the plug-in which contains the imported CSS file is included in your product configuration file.


For example the following stylesheet would import the existing dark theme of the `org.eclipse.ui.themes` plug-in from the Eclipse IDE.

[source,txt]
----
include::res/css/defaultimport.css[]
----


Using this import results in an application styling similar to the following screenshot.
