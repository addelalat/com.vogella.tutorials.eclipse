=== Validating

Start your application. 
The application should be styled according to your CSS file.


After you started the application via the product, the `applicationCSS` property is added to the _plugin.xml_ file for the `org.eclipse.core.runtime.products` extension of your application. 
Check the content of the _plugin.xml_ file

Change the CSS style sheet and restart your application to see the effect.

=== Adjust the build.properties file

Add the created CSS file to your _build.properties_ file in the `com.example.e4.rcp.todo` plug-in to make it available in an exported application.
