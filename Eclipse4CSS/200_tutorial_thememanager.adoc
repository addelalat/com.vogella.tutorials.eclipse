== Exercise: Dynamic style switching with themes
=== Target

In this exercise you use the `IThemeEngine` to introduce the ability to switch the application styling at runtime.

=== Add dependencies


Add the `org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt.theme` plug-in as dependency to your application plug-in.

=== Create a CSS file


Create the following _css/rainbow.css_ file.

[source,css]
----
include::res/css/rainbow.css[]
----

=== Remove the applicationCSS property

Remove the `applicationCSS` property from your product extension. 
For this select the property and press the btn:[Remove] button as depicted in the following screenshot.

=== Create the theme extensions

Select the _Extensions_ tab in the _plugin.xml_ editor and create two extensions for the `org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt.theme` extension point.


You create an extension in the _Extensions_ tab by pressing the btn:[Add...] button.

The following screenshots show the extensions which you should create.

The relevant part in the _plugin.xml_ file should look like the following.

[source,java]
----
include::res/snippets/themeextension.txt[]
----

Add the `cssTheme` property to your product and point to the `com.example.e4.rcp.todo.default` theme.

[WARNING]
====
Ensure that the
`cssTheme`
property is correctly set. Without this initial setting the
`IThemeEngine`
does not work.
====


=== Validating

Start your application and ensure that the application is styled according to the `cssTheme` property setting.

=== Implement a new menu entry

Create a new Java class, which allows you to switch between the themes.

[source,java]
----
include::res/css/ThemeSwitchHandler.java[]
----

Define a new command and a handler in your application model for switching the style.
Assign the above class to the handler.


Add a menu entry to your application model which uses your
handler for switching the style.


=== Validate theme switching

Start the application and select your new menu entry. 
Afterwards the styling of your application should use the _rainbow_ theme.

[NOTE]
====
Changes in styling may require a restart of your application.
The CSS engines resets most of the SWT properties but unfortunately not all widget reacts to this reset.
====


=== Optional: Reusing the dark theme of Eclipse


You can also reuse other CSS themes. To use the dark theme of the
Eclipse IDE, add the
`org.eclipse.ui.themes`
plug-in to your feature.


Create the following file called _dark.css_ in your _css_ folder.


[source,java]
----
include::res/css/dark.css[]
----


Create a new theme pointing to the following new CSS file. Start
your application and validate that you can switch to the dark theme.

=== Adjust the build.properties file

Ensure that all CSS files are selected in your _build.properties_ file in the `com.example.e4.rcp.todo` plug-in to make them available in an exported application.
