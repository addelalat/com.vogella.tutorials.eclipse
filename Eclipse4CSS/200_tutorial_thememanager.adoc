== Exercise: Dynamic style switching with themes
=== Target

The following exercise assumes that you have already implemented
CSS
support for your application based on the last exercise.
In this
exercise you use the
`IThemeEngine`
to introduce the ability
to switch the
application
styling at
runtime.



<title>Add dependencies


Add the
`org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt.theme`
plug-in
as dependency to your application plug-in.



<title>Create a CSS file


Create the following
_css/rainbow.css_
file.


<programlisting>
<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
parse="text" href="../examples/css/rainbow.css" />
</programlisting>



<title>Remove the applicationCSS property

Remove the
`applicationCSS`
property from your product extension. For this select the property
and press the
_Remove_
button as depicted in the following screenshot.

</imageobject>
<textobject>
<phrase>Remove applicationCSS</phrase>
</textobject>
</mediaobject>





<title>Create the theme extensions

Select the
_Extensions_
tab in the 
_plugin.xml_ editor
and create two
extensions for the
`org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt.theme`
extension point.


You create an extension in the
_Extensions_
tab by
pressing the
_Add..._
button.


<mediaobject>
<imageobject>
<imagedata fileref="images/theme06.png"/>
</imageobject>
<textobject>
<phrase>Add button in extension points</phrase>
</textobject>
</mediaobject>


Select the `org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt.theme` extension point and press the _Finish_ button.


<mediaobject>
<imageobject>
<imagedata fileref="images/theme08.png"/>
</imageobject>
<textobject>
<phrase>Selecting</phrase>
</textobject>
</mediaobject>


Right-click on the
`org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt.theme`
extension to create a new theme. The following screenshots show the
extensions which you should create.



<mediaobject>
<imageobject>
<imagedata fileref="images/theme10.png"/>

</imageobject>
</mediaobject>



<mediaobject>
<imageobject>
<imagedata fileref="images/theme20.png"/>

</imageobject>
</mediaobject>


The relevant part in the
_plugin.xml_
file should look like the following.

[source,java]
----
include::res/snippets/themeextension.txt[]
----

Add the `cssTheme` property to your product and point to the `com.example.e4.rcp.todo.default` theme.

[WARNING]
====
Ensure that the
`cssTheme`
property is correctly set. Without this initial setting the
`IThemeEngine`
does not work.
====


=== Validating

Start your application and ensure that the application is styled according to the `cssTheme` property setting.

=== Implement a new menu entry

Create a new Java class, which allows you to switch between the themes.

[source,java]
----
include::res/css/ThemeSwitchHandler.java[]
----

Define a new command and a handler in your application model for switching the style.
Assign the above class to the handler.


Add a menu entry to your application model which uses your
handler for switching the style.


=== Validate theme switching

Start the application and select your new menu entry. 
Afterwards the styling of your application should use the _rainbow_ theme.

[NOTE]
====
Changes in styling may require a restart of your application.
The CSS engines resets most of the SWT properties but unfortunately not all widget reacts to this reset.
====


=== Optional: Reusing the dark theme of Eclipse


You can also reuse other CSS themes. To use the dark theme of the
Eclipse IDE, add the
`org.eclipse.ui.themes`
plug-in to your feature.


Create the following file called _dark.css_ in your _css_ folder.


<programlisting>
<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
parse="text" href="../examples/css/dark.css" />
</programlisting>


Create a new theme pointing to the following new CSS file. Start
your application and validate that you can switch to the dark theme.

=== Adjust the build.properties file

Ensure that all CSS files are selected in your
_build.properties_
file in the
`com.example.e4.rcp.todo`
plug-in to make them available in an exported application.
