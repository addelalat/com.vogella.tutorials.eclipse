== Exercise: Define a custom CSS selector and CSS property

=== Target
In this exercise you will implement your custom CSS selector and property for styling the header of an user profile widget. 
The aim is to apply custom styling to the custom widget, called `UserProfileWidget`.

You will define a new  `UserProfileWidget` CSS selector and a  new `header-background-color` CSS property.
The result may look like that, where the user profile widget is embedded in a `Tooltip`:

=== Add dependencies
Add the `org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.core` and the `org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt` plug-ins as dependency to your application. 

=== Adjust custom CSS to your CSS file

Add the following CSS to your CSS file, which is used in your application plug-in. 

[source,css]
----
include::res/css/user_profile_widget.css[]
----

=== Create the user profile widget
In order to learn how to implement customizations for CSS we also need a custom widget, which should be styled. 
So we implement a really simple custom widget, which is a `Composite` that consists of three other `Composites` for the header, image and description area.
For the following widget you should create a widget package in your plug-in and place the `UserProfileWidget` class into it.

[source,java]
----
include::res/snippets//UserProfileWidget.java[]
----

The most important method for our custom CSS here is the last `setHeaderColor()` method, which we will use for our `header-background-color` CSS property.
In order to test this widget you can place it on a new part in your application or in a tooltip as it is depicted in the screenshot above.
Afterwards you should set a certain header-text, an image and a description-text to 	the `UserProfileWidget`.

=== Adding the org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.core.propertyHandler extension point

Select the _Extensions_ tab in the editor for the _plugin.xml_ file and add the `﻿org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.core.propertyHandler` extension point. 
You create an extension in the _Extensions_ tab by pressing the _Add..._ button.

Select the `﻿org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.core.propertyHandler` extension point and press the _Finish_ button.

By clicking on the `adapter` hyperlink of the handler in the _plugin.xml_ a "New Java Class" dialog appears, where you define the `CompositeElement` as superclass. 
Call the class itself `UserProfileElementAdapter` and place it into a css package.

image::new_class_dialog_user_profile_element_adapter.png[pdfwidth=60%]

The `UserProfileElementAdapter` class should look like this:

[source,java]
----
include::res/snippets//UserProfileElementAdapter.java[]
----

In this case we only have a custom composite, which needs to be adapted. 
The `propertyHandler` needs a `handler`, which has to be an implementation of the `ICSSPropertyHandler` interface. 
Therefore we need to click on the `handler` hyperlink in the _plugin.xml_ and the following "New Java Class" dialog appears:

image::new_class_dialog_user_profile_css_handler.png[pdfwidth=60%]

The `AbstractCSSPropertySWTHandler` is an abstraction of the `ICSSPropertyHandler` interface for SWT widgets. 
It handles the cast to a	SWT Control, which is then passed to the `applyCSSProperty` and `retrieveCSSProperty` methods.
In the `UserProfileCSSHandler` implementation we apply the `header-background-color` to our `UserProfileWidget`.

[source,java]
----
include::res/snippets/UserProfileCSSHandler.java[]
----

At first we check, if the given `Control` is a `UserProfileWidget` and cast it. 
Then we check, if the property, which should be applied, is our `﻿header-background-color`. 
In case these checks are valid the `﻿CSSEngine` can be used to convert the given `﻿CSSValue` in our case to a `Color`. 
Finally we set this color for the header of our custom widget.

[NOTE]
====
If you are using a different UI toolkit than SWT you must only implement the `ICSSPropertyHandler` interface, rather than the `AbstractCSSPropertySWTHandler`.
This interface passes an `java.lang.Object` and does not check for a SWT Control .
====

The last thing we need to do for the propertyHandler extension is to define for which `property-name` this handler is responsible:

=== Adding the org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.core.elementProvider extension point
Now the second and last extension point has to be added:

image::element_provider_extension.png[pdfwidth=60%]

After adding the `org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.core.elementProvider` extension point we can add an `IElementProvider` to it.
For this, click on the `class` hyperlink and give the class the name `UserProfileWidgetElementProvider`.

image::element_provider_provider_definition.png[pdfwidth=60%]

The `widget` property you can see in the screenshot above points to the full qualified name of the `UserProfileWidget` `(com.vogella.rcp.css.custom.widget.UserProfileWidget)`. 
The `widget` property may be used several times, so that one `IElementProvider` implementation can be in charge of several widgets.
The `UserProfileWidgetElementProvider` class we just created by clicking the `class` hyperlink in the _plugin.xml_ implements the `IElementProvider` interface and should look like this:

[source,java]
----
include::res/snippets//UserProfileWidgetElementProvider.java[]
----

In this `IElementProvider` implementation we return the  `UserProfileElementAdapter`, which we previously defined, when we 	attached this adapter to the `propertyHandler`.

=== Validating
Now we can check, if our custom CSS definitions are applied to the `UserProfileWidget`. 
Make sure that you have done all the steps and then start your application.

* The `UserProfileWidget` has been applied to a Part and a sample header-text, image and description-text has been set for the widget.
* The CSS snippet has been added to the active CSS file
* You have configured the `org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.core.propertyHandler` and `org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.core.elementProvider` extension points correctly
