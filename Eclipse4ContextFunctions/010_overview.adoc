== Context functions

=== What are context functions?

A _context function_
is an OSGi service which has access to the
`IEclipseContext`
. It
allows you to lazily create an object for a given key if this key
is
not contained in the relevant
`IEclipseContext`.

The context
function registers itself for a certain key, for
example a
class
name.
Whenever the Eclipse
dependency
injection does not find an
existing object
under this key, it calls the
`compute()`
method of the object registered as context function.

In this
`compute()`
method the context function creates
the requested
object. As input you
receive the local
`IEclipseContext`
in which the injection was invoked and the requested key.

It can also
persist the created object into the
context so that
successive calls will return the same generated
object.

=== Creation of a context function

Context functions
are typically contributed as OSGi services. They
extend the
`ContextFunction`
class from the
`org.eclipse.e4.core.contexts`
package. The Eclipse runtime adds
context functions
by default to the
application context.

They register itself as OSGi service for the
`IContextFunction`
interface.

[TIP]
====
Question: Why should you register your service for the
`IContextFunction`
interface
but extend the
`ContextFunction`
class?

Answer:
If the interface gets another method in a later
Eclipse
release
your
service continues to work, as the abstract
class
`ContextFunction`
can provide a default implementation.
====

You need to specify the key the context function is responsible for. This is done via the
_service.context.key_
property in the service definition.

If the key is a class you have to point to the fully qualified class.
This key can
be used for dependency
injection.
If
you register a key which is not a class name, a consumer of
the injection would
have to use
the
`@Named`
annotation to specify the key.

=== Examples for context function registrations

The following example shows the declaration of a
context function.
This
function is available in the application context
and responsible
for
the
`vogella`
key.

This key can be used for dependency injection as demonstrated in
the following example.

[source,java]

include::res/contextfunctions/Inject.java[]

The following example demonstrates a possible implementation of
this context function which used OSGi DS annotations.

=== When to use context functions?

Using
context functions
instead of a OSGi services has the
advantage
that these functions
have
access to the
`IEclipseContext`
hierarchy. They have access to the context in which the dependency
injection was called.

This allows them to lazily create objects using values from the
context.

Standard OSGi services
have no direct access to
the
`IEclipseContext`
.

=== Publishing to the OSGi service registry from a context function

OSGi services may need to access the objects created by a
context
function. In this case you can also publish an
OSGi service
from a
context
function.

The
following example demonstrates how to publish an
implementation into
the
`IEclipseContext`
and to the OSGi service registry.
