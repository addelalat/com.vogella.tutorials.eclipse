== Accessing and extending the Eclipse context

=== Accessing the context

You can place objects directly in the
`IEclipseContext`
hierarchy to make them available to other model objects.

To access an
existing
context you can use dependency injection if
the
relevant
object is
managed by the Eclipse runtime.
This is the case
for
all model objects. The following code demonstrates how to get access
to the active
`IEclipseContext`
, in which the handler is called.

If a model object implements
`MContext`
,
you can use dependency injection to get the model object injected
and
call the
`getContext()`
method to access its context. For example, MPart, MWindow,
MApplication and MPerspective extend MContext.

The following code demonstrates how to get the
`MApplication`
injected and how to access its
`IEclipseContext`.

=== Objects and context variables

You can add key / value pairs directly to the
`IEclipseContext`.

Adding objects to
a context can be done via
the
`set()`
method of the
`IEclipseContext`
interface.
The following example creates a new context via the
`EclipseContextFactory.create()`
factory method call and adds some objects to it. Via the
`setParent()`
method call, the new context is connected to the context hierarchy.

[source,java]
----
include::res/snippets/addingtoexisting.txt[]
----

Such a context can be used to instantiate an object via the
Eclipse
framework.

A
_context variable_
is a key which is
declared as
_modifiable_
via the
`declareModifiable(key)`
method call.

[source,java]
----
include::res/snippets/makecontextvariable.txt[]
----

Context variables are added to particular levels of the
`IEclipseContext`
hierarchy and can also be modified using the
`modify()`
method rather than
`set()`
method of the
`IEclipseContext`.
The
`modify()`
method searches up the chain to find the
`IEclipseContext`
defining the variable. If no entry is found in the context hierarchy,
the value will be
set in the
`IEclipseContext`
in which the call started.

If the key already exists in the context,
then
`modify()`
requires that the key has been set to modifiable with the
`declareModifiable()`
method, if not, the method
throws an
exception.

You can add key/value pairs and
_Context variables_
at different levels of the context hierarchy to supply different
objects in your application.

=== Replacing existing objects in the IEclipseContext

Instead of adding new objects to the
`IEclipseContext`
hierarchy, you can also override existing objects by using
the same
key.

You can change behavior of your application by overriding
certain
entries in the context.
For example, you can modify
the context of the
_MWindow_
model element. Its
`IEclipseContext`
is originally created by the
`WBWRenderer`
class. By default it puts an instance
of the
`IWindowCloseHandler`
and the
`ISaveHandler`
interface
into the local context of the
_MWindow_
model element. The
`IWindowCloseHandler`
object is responsible for
the
behavior once the
_MWindow_
model element is closed. The default
`IWindowCloseHandler`
prompts the user if he wants to save
dirty parts (editors with changed
content). You can change this default
implementation by replacing the
object in the context. The following example shows an
`@Execute`
method in a handler implementation which overrides this class at
runtime.

[source,java]

TIP: You could use this example in your life cycle handler and subscribe
to the
`UIEvents.UILifeCycle.APP_STARTUP_COMPLETE`
event. In the event handler you would replace the
`IWindowCloseHandler`
handler in the context.

=== Accessing the IEclipseContext hierarchy from OSGi services

OSGi services are not directly part of the
`IEclipseContext`
hierarchy and are created by the OSGi runtime. The OSGi runtime does
not support dependency injection based on the
`@Inject`
annotation.

The Eclipse framework
registers the implementation of the
`MApplication`
interface
also as an OSGi service. This allows OSGi services to use
the OSGi API to access the
`MApplication`
and its context via the
`getContext()`
method. As the
`EModelService`
is part of the
`MApplication`
context you can search for other context elements via
it.

=== Model add-ons

To participate in dependency injection with your custom Java
objects
you can add them as model add-ons
to the
application model.
The classes
referred to by the
model add-ons can
access and modify the
`IEclipseContext`
or
interact with other services,
e.g., the event system.

The following screenshot shows a custom model add-on registered
in the application model.

The following code shows an example implementation for the model
addon class. This addon places an object into the
`IEclipseContext`

=== RunAndTrack

The
`IEclipseContext`
allows you via the
`runAndTrack()`
method to register a Java object of type
`RunAndTrack`.

A
`RunAndTrack`
object
is basically a
`Runnable`
which has access to the context.

If the context changes, the
`RunAndTrack`
is called by the Eclipse framework.
The runnable does not need to be
explicitly unregistered from
this
context when it is
no
longer
interested in tracking changes. If
the
`RunAndTrack`
is invoked by the Eclipse platform and it
returns
`false`
from its
`RunAndTrack.changed()`
method, it is
automatically unregistered
from change tracking on
this
context.

Such a
`RunAndTrack`
object
allows a client to keep some external state
synchronized
with
one
or more values
in this context.
