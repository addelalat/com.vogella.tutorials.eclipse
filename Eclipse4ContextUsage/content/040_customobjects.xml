			Using dependency injection is not limited to the objects created by
			the
			Eclipse runtime. You can use the same approach
			to create an instance of a given class based on a given
			<code>IEclipseContext</code>
			. The given class can contain
			@Inject annotations.
			For this you use the
			<code>ContextInjectionFactory</code>
			class as demonstrated in the following code example.
		
		
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="../examples/snippets/injectown.txt" />
			</programlisting>
		
		
			The
			<code>ContextInjectionFactory.make()</code>
			method creates the object. You can also put it into the
			<code>IEclipseContext</code>
			hierarchy
			after the creation. If you place it into the
			<code>IEclipseContext</code>
			of the application, the created object is globally available.
		

		
			For this you can either use an existing
			<code>IEclipseContext</code>
			or create a new
			<code>IEclipseContext</code>
			.
			The new context object can be connected to the context hierarchy.
			Using a new context might be preferable to
			avoid
			collision of keys and
			to
			isolate your changes in a local
			context. Call the
			<code>dispose</code>
			method on your local context, if the object is not needed anymore.
		

		
			The following code demonstrates how to create a new
			<code>IEclipseContext</code>
			object and to place values into it. This context can be used to
			create a new object.
		
		
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="../examples/snippets/createContext.txt" />
			</programlisting>
		

		
			The next code example demonstrates how you can connect your new
			<code>IEclipseContext</code>
			object with an existing context hierarchy. The factory searches
			the
			hierarchy upwards to find values, requested by the
			class which is
			instantiated.
		
		
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="../examples/snippets/createContext2.txt" />
			</programlisting>
		
		
			The
			<code>ContextInjectionFactory.inject(Object, IEclipseContext)</code>
			method allows you to perform injection on an existing object. For
			example, if you created the object with the
			<code>new()</code>
			operator, you can
			still run dependency injection on it.
		
	
[[ownobjects_difrom">
=== Create your custom objects automatically with @Creatable
		
		<indexterm>
			<primary>@Creatable</primary>
		</indexterm>
		
			If you want the Eclipse framework to create your custom objects
			for
			you,
			annotate them with
			<code>@Creatable</code>
			. This way you are telling the Eclipse DI container that it should
			create
			a new instance of this object if it does not
			find an instance
			in the
			context. The automatically-generated instance is not stored in
			the context.
		
		
			If you have a non default-constructor, you must use
			the
			<code>@Inject</code>
			annotation
			on the constructor to indicate that Eclipse should try to
			run
			dependency injection on it.
		
		For example, assume that you have the following domain model.
		
		
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="../examples/di_own/Dependent.java" />
			</programlisting>
		

		
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="../examples/di_own/YourObject.java" />
			</programlisting>
		

		
			As the Eclipse framework is allowed to create instances of the
			<code>Dependent</code>
			and the
			<code>YourObject</code>
			class, it can create them if an instance is requested via
			dependency
			injection. In this example the arguments of the
			constructors can be
			satisfied.
			If no fitting constructor is found, the
			Eclipse framework
			throws
			an
			exception.
		
		
			Assuming that you have defined the
			<code>ITodoService</code>
			OSGi
			service in your application, you
			can get an instance of your
			<code>YourObject</code>
			class injected into a part. The following example code demonstrates
			that.
		

		
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="../examples/di_own/usage.java" />
			</programlisting>
		

	
[[ownobjects_singletons">
=== Create automatically objects in the application context with @Singleton
		<indexterm>
			<primary>@Singleton</primary>
		</indexterm>
		
			If the object should be created in the application context, use the
			<code>@Singleton</code>
			annotation in addition to the
			<code>@Creatable</code>
			annotation. This ensures that only one instance of the object is
			created in your application.
		
		
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text"
					href="../examples/di_own/YourObjectSingleton.java" />
			</programlisting>
