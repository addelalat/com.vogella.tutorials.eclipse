== Eclipse API best practice

=== Application communication

A simple way of propagating user interface selections is the selection service (`ESelectionService`) of the Eclipse platform. 
Use this service to propagate the current selection of a window.

For general scoped communication it is recommended to use the Eclipse context (`IEclipseContext`).

The event service (`IEventBroker`)is a good choice, if there is no scope involved in the communication and if the events should not be persisted in the Eclipse context.
The strengths of the event service is that arbitrary listeners can listen to  events and that the publish and subscribe mechanism is relatively simple.

Frequently the event service is also used together with a modification of the Eclipse context. 
The following section contains an example for this.

=== Example: Using events together with the IEclipseContext

The following example demonstrates the registration for events
and how the provided information is used to modify
the context.

Assume that on every change of the active part you want to place a
variable called
_myactivePartId_
into the
`IEclipseContext`. This can be done via the following code.

[source,java]
----
include::res/eventadmin/activate2.java[]
----

This context variable can be used
to define a visible-when clause
which can be used to
restrict the visibility of
menus and toolbars.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/eventadmin/plugin.xml[]
----

=== Which dependency injection approach to use for your implementation

The application can add or modify the behavior of the dependency injection
mechanisms. You
have several options for
this. The most common approaches are the following:

* OSGi services
* Context modifications of the Eclipse context 
* Context functions
* Extended object suppliers for custom annotations
* Model add-ons

All are valid options for your implementation. 
The programming model of Eclipse 4 makes it easy to
create and
use OSGi services. OSGi services do not have access
to the Eclipse
application context.
OSGi services are a good approach for
infrastructure
services.

Context functions allow you to create objects based on the
Eclipse context. They also allow you to persist the
created object
in the context hierarchy.
If access to the context is required, you use
context functions instead
of
pure
OSGi services.

Storing the key/value pairs in the Eclipse context (as context elements or
context variables)
allows you to persist
them in the hierarchy and to
propagate them to
elements down in the relevant hierarchy. You can
also replace
(override)
Eclipse platform implementations in the
context. For
example you can change the default
window
close handler.

Via extended object suppliers you can define your custom
annotations and provide processors for them. Extended
object
supplier do not have access to the Eclipse context, but can access
data from different sources. For example, you
could implement a
provider for preferences which are stored in the network instead of
the file system.

Model add-ons
allow you to contribute Java objects to the
application
model. A
model add-on registers itself typically to
events from the
`IEclipseBroker`
and
can contribute functionality based on these events.
