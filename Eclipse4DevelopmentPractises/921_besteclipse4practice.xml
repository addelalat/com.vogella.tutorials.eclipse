		<para>
			A simple way of propagating user interface selections is the
			selection service (
			<code>ESelectionService</code>
			) of the Eclipse platform. Use this service to
			propagate the current
			selection of a window.
		</para>
		<para>
			For general scoped communication it is recommended to use the
			Eclipse
			context (
			<code>IEclipseContext</code>
			).
		</para>
		<para>
			The event service (
			<code>IEventBroker</code>
			)
			is a good choice, if there is no scope involved in the
			communication
			and if the events should not be persisted in the
			Eclipse context. The
			strengths of
			the event service
			is
			that arbitrary
			listeners can listen to
			events and that the
			publish
			and
			subscribe mechanism is relatively
			simple.
		</para>
		<para>Frequently the event service is also used together with a
			modification of the Eclipse context. The following
			section contains
			an example for this.

		<title>Which dependency injection approach to use for your implementation</title>
		<para>
			The application can add or modify the behavior of the dependency injection
			mechanisms. You
			have several options for
			this. The most common approaches are the following:
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>OSGi services</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Context modifications of the Eclipse context </para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Context functions</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Extended object suppliers for custom annotations</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Model add-ons</para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
			.
		</para>
		<para>All are valid options for your implementation. </para>
		<para>The programming model of Eclipse 4 makes it easy to
			create and
			use OSGi services. OSGi services do not have access
			to the Eclipse
			application context.
			OSGi services are a good approach for
			infrastructure
			services.
		</para>
		<para>
			Context functions allow you to create objects based on the
			Eclipse context. They also allow you to persist the
			created object
			in the context hierarchy.
			If access to the context is required, you use
			context functions instead
			of
			pure
			OSGi services.
		</para>
		<para>
			Storing the key/value pairs in the Eclipse context (as context elements or
			context variables)
			allows you to persist
			them in the hierarchy and to
			propagate them to
			elements down in the relevant hierarchy. You can
			also replace
			(override)
			Eclipse platform implementations in the
			context. For
			example you can change the default
			window
			close handler.
		</para>

		<para>Via extended object suppliers you can define your custom
			annotations and provide processors for them. Extended
			object
			supplier do not have access to the Eclipse context, but can access
			data from different sources. For example, you
			could implement a
			provider for preferences which are stored in the network instead of
			the file system.
		</para>
		<para>
			Model add-ons
			allow you to contribute Java objects to the
			application
			model. A
			model add-on registers itself typically to
			events from the
			<code>IEclipseBroker</code>
			and
			can contribute functionality based on these events.
		</para>
