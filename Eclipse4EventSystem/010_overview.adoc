== Communication within your Eclipse application

=== Event based communication

In your application you frequently have the need to communicate
between application components. This communication should be loosely
coupled, to remove dependency between the components and to increase
reuse of these components.
		
This can be archived by the subscriber/ publisher model
implemented as an event system.
Software
components
can
register for
specified events and other
components
can
send
events out. The event system ensures that all registered components receive
the event they registered for. .

=== The event bus of Eclipse
		
For this purpose
the Eclipse platform
provides a global event
based
communication system, called the
_event bus_.

Any software component which has access to the event system can
send out arbitrary events as depicted in the following graphic.

The Eclipse platform will make sure that registered components
receive the messages. The Eclipse platform uses this event system for
the
internal
communication.

=== Event service
		
The Eclipse framework provides the event service for event
communication.
This service can be accessed via dependency injection
based on the
`IEventBroker`
interface.
This communication service can also be used
to
communicate
between your
own application components.
		
The Eclipse
event service
is based on the OSGi
_EventAdmin_
service but has been wrapped with a simpler API.

=== Required plug-ins to use the event service
		
The following plug-ins are required to use the
event service
functionality:

* `org.eclipse.e4.core.services`
* `org.eclipse.osgi.services`
