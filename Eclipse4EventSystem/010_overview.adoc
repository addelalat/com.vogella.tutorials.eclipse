== Communication within your Eclipse application

=== Event based communication

In your application you frequently have the need to communicate between application components.
If this communication is loosely coupled, you can develop and test the components in isolation, which improves software qualify.
		
This can be archived by the subscriber/ publisher model implemented as an event system.
Software components can register for certain events.
Components can send such events. 
The event system ensures that all registered components receive the event they registered for.

=== The event bus of Eclipse
		
For this purpose the Eclipse platform provides a global event based communication system, called the _event bus_.

Any software component which has access to the event system can send out arbitrary events as depicted in the following graphic.

The Eclipse platform makes sure that registered components receive the messages.
The Eclipse platform uses this event system for the internal communication.

=== Event service
		
The Eclipse framework provides the event service for event communication.
This service can be accessed via dependency injection based on the `IEventBroker` interface.
This communication service can also be used to communicate between your own application components.

[NOTE]
====
The Eclipse event service is based on the OSGi _EventAdmin_ service.
====

=== Required plug-ins to use the event service
		
The following plug-ins are required to use the event service functionality:

* `org.eclipse.e4.core.services`
* `org.eclipse.osgi.services`

=== Sending out events

The event service can be injected via dependency injection.

The following code examples assume that you have a class named _MyEventConstants_.
This class contains a static final field (constant) to define a string.

The event service allows to notify the registered components.
This can be done asynchronously or synchronously.

You can now send arbitrary Java objects or primitives through the event bus.

=== Registration for events for receiving events

You can use dependency injection to register and respond to events.
In this case the Eclipse framework automatically removes all event subscriptions when the model class is disposed.

The `@EventTopic` and `@UIEventTopic` annotations tag methods and fields that should be notified on event changes.
The `@UIEventTopic` ensures the event notification is performed in the user interface thread.

An object can also register directly an instance of the `org.osgi.service.event.EventHandler` via the `IEventBroker.subscribe()` method. 
To unsubscribe use the `unsubscribe()` method.


[TIP]
====
Using dependency injection for subscribing should be preferred compared to the direct subscription.
This way the framework handles the listener registration and de-registration automatically for you.
But sometimes it is useful to control when to listening to events, for, example  when an event should only received once.

=== Which objects should be send out?

The event system allows sending and receiving objects of an arbitrary type.
Often it is sufficient to send the desired object through an event.
But it is good practice to use a map like structure for sending events, i.e., to have common interface for events.

=== Subscribing to sub-topics

You can subscribe to specific topics or use wildcards to subscribe to all sub-events.
Sub-events are separated by `/`.
The following example code defines string constants including the `TOPIC_TODO_ALLTOPICS` constant.
This constant can be used to register for all sub-events.

=== Event system compared to Eclipse context

The `IEventBroker` is a global event bus and is unaware of the `IEclipseContext` hierarchy.
The `IEventBroker` service supports sending event information without knowing who is receiving it.
Interested classes can register for events without knowing who is going to provide them.
This is known as the whiteboard pattern and this pattern supports the creation of very loosely coupled application components.

The disadvantage is that it is a global bus, i.e. there is no scoping of the events.
Publishers have to ensure they provide enough information in the topic and the send object to allow subscribers to discriminate and decide that the particular event is applicable to a subscriber.

=== Asynchronous processing and the event bus

Your threads can use the `IEventBroker` to send event data.
The event listeners are called by the framework.
If the method is annotated with the `UIEventTopic` annotation, it is called in the main thread.
