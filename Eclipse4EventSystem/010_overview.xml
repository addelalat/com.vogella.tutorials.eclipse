			In your application you frequently have the need to communicate
			between application components. This communication should be loosely
			coupled, to remove dependency between the components and to increase
			reuse of these components.
		
		This can be archived by the subscriber/ publisher model
			implemented as an event system.
			Software
			components
			can
			register for
			specified events and other
			components
			can
			send
			events out. The event system ensures that all registered components receive
			the event they registered for. .
		
	
[[eventsystem_overview">
=== The event bus of Eclipse
		
			For this purpose
			the Eclipse platform
			provides a global event
			based
			communication system, called the
			_event bus_
			.
		

		Any software component which has access to the event system can
			send out arbitrary events as depicted in the following graphic.

		The Eclipse platform will make sure that registered components
			receive the messages. The Eclipse platform uses this event system for
			the
			internal
			communication.

			The Eclipse framework provides the event service for event
			communication.
			This service can be accessed via dependency injection
			based on the
			<code>IEventBroker</code>
			interface.
			This communication service can also be used
			to
			communicate
			between your
			own application components.
		
		
			The Eclipse
			event service
			is based on the OSGi
			_EventAdmin_
			service but has been wrapped with a simpler API.
