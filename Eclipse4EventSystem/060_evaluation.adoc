== Usage of the event system

The
`IEventBroker`
is a global event bus and is unaware of the
`IEclipseContext`
hierarchy. The
`IEventBroker`
service supports
sending event
information without
knowing who
is
receiving
it. Interested
classes
can register for
events without
knowing
who is
going to provide
them.
This is known as
the whiteboard
pattern and
this pattern supports the creation of very loosely
coupled application
components.

The disadvantage is that it is a global bus, i.e. there is no
scoping of the events. Publishers have to ensure they provide enough
information in the topic and the send object to allow subscribers to
discriminate and decide that the
particular event is applicable to a
subscriber.
