	<title>Usage of the event system</title>

	<para>
		The
		<code>IEventBroker</code>
		is a global event bus and is unaware of the
		<code>IEclipseContext</code>
		hierarchy. The
		<code>IEventBroker</code>
		service supports
		sending event
		information without
		knowing who
		is
		receiving
		it. Interested
		classes
		can register for
		events without
		knowing
		who is
		going to provide
		them.
		This is known as
		the whiteboard
		pattern and
		this pattern supports the creation of very loosely
		coupled application
		components.
	</para>
	<para>The disadvantage is that it is a global bus, i.e. there is no
		scoping of the events. Publishers have to ensure they provide enough
		information in the topic and the send object to allow subscribers to
		discriminate and decide that the
		particular event is applicable to a
		subscriber.
