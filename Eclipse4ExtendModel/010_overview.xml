			The application
			model you create for your Eclipse based
			application is
			based on
			an Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) model
			defined by
			the
			Eclipse platform. This
			structure
			defines, for example, that
			an
			<code>MPart</code> can
			be stored in an <code>MPartSashContainer</code>.
		
		
			The
			Eclipse platform uses generated Java classes based on this EMF
			model. These classes are instantiated based on the
			<filename>Application.e4xmi</filename>
			file of the application including formation from model fragments,
			processors and other sources which modify the model, e.g., mode
			add-ons.
		
		
			The Eclipse platform registers listeners on the attributes of
			these objects, so that it can react immediately if a model property
			changes.
		
	
[[applicationmodelextension_extensions">
=== Using extensions
		
			The underlying structure of the application model can be
			extended
			by customers using
			standard EMF functionality. As
			the
			renderer
			framework
			is
			responsible for
			handling the
			model elements, you
			have to
			define a
			renderer which is
			responsible for
			the new model
			elements.
		
	
[[e4tools_editor">
=== Adding an editor for a custom model elements
		
			The
			<code>org.eclipse.e4.tools.emf.ui</code>
			plug-in defines the
			<code>org.eclipse.e4.tools.emf.ui.editors</code>
			extension point, which allows registering editors for new model
			elements.
