== Exercise: Use model extensions

=== Exercise: Create the application

Create a new Eclipse RCP application called
_com.vogella.e4.appmodel.app_.

Add
a dependency to the following plug-ins:

* `com.vogella.e4.appmodel.extension`
* `com.vogella.e4.appmodel.renderer`

NOTE: You have to manually adjust the application model, as the
default editors don't support your new model elements. It is
possible
to develop custom components in the editor to handle your
extensions
but that is beyond this description.

Add your model name space to the
_Application.e4xmi_
file. Please note that
_xmlns:extension="http://www.vogella.com/ui/e4/extension_
defines the
UI of your model extension. By this you can use
`extension:modelelement`
in the file referring to your custom model
elements.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/renderer/Application.e4xmi[]
----

Afterwards add your new part implementation to a part, the
snippet to add it listed below.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/renderer/Application2.e4xmi[]
----

=== Register your factory via an extension point

As a last step add the property
`rendererFactoryUri`
to your
product in
_plugin.xml_
with a link to your new factory:
_platform:/plugin/com.vogella.e4.renderer.maps/com.vogella.e4.renderer.maps.MyRendererFactory_

[source,xml]
----
include::res/renderer/plugin2.xml[]
----

=== Run your application

Run your application. The result should display the webpage to which
you pointed via the
_uri_
parameter.
