== Eclipse application life cycle

=== Connecting to the Eclipse application life cycle

If an
application is
started or stopped, it typically requires
some
central setup or shutdown. For example you want
to connect to a
database or
close the database connection.

The Eclipse platform allows you
to register a class for
predefined events
of
this
life cycle.
For example
you can
use
these
life
cycle
hooks to create a
login
screen or an interactive splash screen
before
the
application is
started.

=== Accessing application startup parameters

The
`IApplicationContext`
object which can be injected into your life cycle class contains
information about the startup parameters of your
application. You can
access these parameters via the
`getArguments()`
method.

The access is demonstrated by the following snippet.

[source,java]
----
include::res/arguments/access.java[]
----

A parameter can be a flag or can have a parameter and a value.
You can use a method similar to the following to
evaluate this.

[source,java]
----
include::res/arguments/getValue.java[]
----

=== Close static splash screen

If you configured in your product configuration file that a static
splash screen should be used, you can call the
`applicationRunning()`
method on the
`IApplicationContext`
object. You typically call this method if you want to replace the
static splash screen with a dynamic screen developed
with SWT.

=== How to implement a life cycle class

The
`org.eclipse.core.runtime.product`
extension point allows you to define a
class as life cycle callback
via a
property.

The key for this property is
`lifeCycleURI`
and it
points to the class via the
`bundleclass://`
schema.

In the class
you can annotate methods with the following
annotations. These
methods are called by the framework
depending on
the
life cycle of
your application.

.Life cycle annotations
|===
|Annotation |Description

|@PostContextCreate
|Is called after the Applicationâ€™s
`IEclipseContext`
is created, can be used to add objects, services, etc. to the
context.
This context is created for the
`MApplication`
class.

|@ProcessAdditions
|Is called directly before the model is passed to the
renderer, can be used to add additional elements to
the model.

|@ProcessRemovals
|Same as @ProcessAdditions but for removals.

|@PreSave
|Is called before the application model is saved. You can
modify the model before it is persisted.

=== Example life cycle implementation

The following example shows how to register a class in your
_plugin.xml_
file as life cycle handler. To avoid that the code wraps we use
`testing`
as BundleSymbolicName and package, you need to replace that with the correct values for your life cycle class.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/life/plugin.xml[]
----

The following class displays a
`Shell`
until the startup process of your application has finished.
You could
extend this example to show a progress bar.

[source,java]
----
include::res/life/LifeCycleManager.java[]
----
