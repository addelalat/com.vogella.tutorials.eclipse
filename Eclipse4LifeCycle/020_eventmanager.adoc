== Life cycle hook and a login screen

=== Target

In this exercise you create a splash screen which allows the user to
enter his or her
credentials. This assumes that you have created a
`PasswordDialog`
class  which allows the user to enter this user and password.

=== Create a new class

The following development is done again in the
`com.example.e4.rcp.todo`
plug-in.

Create the
`com.example.e4.rcp.todo.lifecycle`
package and add the following class.

[source,java]
----
include::res/event/LifeCycleManager.java[]
----

NOTE: The life cycle annotations are
not yet released as official API. 

=== Register life cycle hook

Register the
`Manager`
class as life cycle handler in your
_plugin.xml_
file.

For this, open the
_plugin.xml_
in your application plug-in and select the
_Extensions_
tab.

Open the
`org.eclipse.core.runtime.products`
extension,
right click on the existing entry and create a new
property.

Enter
_lifeCycleURI_
as name for the property and use
`bundleclass://com.example.e4.rcp.todo/com.example.e4.rcp.todo.lifecycle.Manager` as the value.

The following snippet shows the resulting plugin.xml file.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/event/plugin.xml[]
----

=== Validating

Start your application. The login dialog should get displayed and
your
application should be started after the user selects the
btn:[Login] button.
