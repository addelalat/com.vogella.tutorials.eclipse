		The application model of an Eclipse application is available at
		runtime. The
		application can access the model and
		change it via a
		defined API.
	
	
		To analyzing this application model and for testing model changes, you can use a test tool from the e4 tools
		project
		which
		allows modifying the application model interactively.
		This tool is called
		_Model Spy_
		(used to be called: Live model editor) and can be
		integrated
		into your
		RCP
		application. Most changes are directly applied, e.g., if you
		change
		the
		orientation of a part sash container,
		your user interface is updated automatically.
	



	
		In the model spy, you can select a
		part
		in the application model, right
		click on
		it and
		select
		_Show Control_
		to get the
		part
		highlighted.
