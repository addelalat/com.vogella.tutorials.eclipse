		The application model of an Eclipse application is available at
		runtime. The
		application can access the model and
		change it via a
		defined API.
	</para>
	<para>
		To analyzing this application model and for testing model changes, you can use a test tool from the e4 tools
		project
		which
		allows modifying the application model interactively.
		This tool is called
		<wordasword>Model Spy</wordasword>
		(used to be called: Live model editor) and can be
		integrated
		into your
		RCP
		application. Most changes are directly applied, e.g., if you
		change
		the
		orientation of a part sash container,
		your user interface is updated automatically.
	</para>



	<para>
		In the model spy, you can select a
		part
		in the application model, right
		click on
		it and
		select
		<guilabel>Show Control</guilabel>
		to get the
		part
		highlighted.
