== Model spy and the Eclipse IDE
	
If installed you can also use the model spy to see the application
model of the running Eclipse IDE itself. You can
open it via
the
kbd:[Alt+Shift+F9] shortcut.

WARNING: If you modify the Eclipse IDE model, you should be careful as this might put the running Eclipse IDE into a bad state. 
To fix such issues, start the Eclipse IDE from the command line with the _-clearPersistedState_ parameter.
