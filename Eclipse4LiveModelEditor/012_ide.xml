	<title>Model spy and the Eclipse IDE

	
		If installed you can also use the model spy to see the application
		model of the running Eclipse IDE itself. You can
		open it via
		the
		<keycombo>
			<keycap>Alt</keycap>
			<keycap>Shift</keycap>
			<keycap>F9</keycap>
		</keycombo>
		shortcut.

	
	<warning>
		
			If you
			modify
			the
			Eclipse IDE model, you
			should
			be careful as this
			might
			put
			the
			running
			Eclipse IDE into a bad
			state. To fix
			such issues, start the Eclipse IDE from the command line with the
			<parameter>-clearPersistedState</parameter>
			parameter.
