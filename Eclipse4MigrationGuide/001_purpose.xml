== Running and migrating an Eclipse 3.x RCP application

=== Using the Eclipse 3.x API on top of an 4.x runtime
		
		
			It is possible to run Eclipse 3.x API based plug-ins and RCP applications
			on top of the Eclipse 4.x platform. The
			Eclipse 3.x API has been reworked to use the 4.x underneath. This is sometimes called the
			_compatibility mode_
			.
			See
			<xref linkend="compatibiliymode_overview" />
			for more information about it.
		
		The Eclipse platform team plans to
			support this
			layer for an unlimited period of time.
			Therefore, if you have an
			existing Eclipse 3.x application, you do
			not
			have to migrate
			to the
			Eclipse 4.x API.
		

	

=== Technical reasons for migrating to the 4.x API
		
		The Eclipse 3.x API is
			effectively
			frozen, therefore it is recommended to migrate to the latest 4.x API to participate and
			benefit from further enhancements in the Eclipse platform.
		
		Another important technical reason to migrate to the Eclipse 4.x API
			is
			that it
			provides a consistent and well-designed
			API. The concept of
			the
			application model and dependency injection
			makes your application
			code
			concise and flexible.
			Services and the renderer toolkit can be
			replaced, which adds more flexibility to your implementation.
		
		The event service and the extensible Eclipse context hierarchy
			provide very powerful ways to communicate within
			your application.
