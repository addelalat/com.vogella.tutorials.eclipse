			It is possible to define new e4 API based components and use them in an application which still uses the
			Eclipse 3.x
			API.
			This allows contributing e4 API based views, menus
			and toolbars to such an application.
			By using this approach, you
			can convert
			these 3.x components step by step to e4 API. How this can be done is shown in the following
			chapters.
		
	

=== Extending the Eclipse IDE
		The Eclipse IDE uses the same
			approach as an Eclipse 3.x application on top of an e4 runtime. The e4 API based
			extensions described in this chapter can, of course, also be used to extend the Eclipse IDE.
