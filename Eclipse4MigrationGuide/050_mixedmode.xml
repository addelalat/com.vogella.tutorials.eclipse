=== Example for using 3.x components in e4 API based applications
		
			If you choose to try this approach despite the warning, you have to
			define a
			_LegacyIDE.e4xmi_
			file similar to the Eclipse IDE and add your
			model components to this
			file. This file can be found
			in the
			`org.eclipse.ui.workbench`
			plug-in.
		
		
			Point to that file via the
			_applicationXMI_
			parameter in
			your
			`org.eclipse.core.runtime.products`
			extension.
		
		
			A code example for this approach can be found under the
			following
			URL:
		
		
			<programlisting language="text">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/link.txt[]
----
		
		As said before, this approach is not officially supported by the Eclipse
			platform team. If you use this approach,
			you
			may find hard to solve issues.
