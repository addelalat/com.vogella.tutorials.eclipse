=== Migration to Eclipse 4
		
			If you want to migrate your Eclipse 3.x RCP application to the
			Eclipse
			4 programming model, you can't directly reuse existing
			<filename>plugin.xml</filename>
			based user interface components, e.g.
			views
			or
			editors
			based on the
			definition in
			<filename>plugin.xml</filename>
			.
		
		
			Migrating such components would involve:

					Converting existing user interface contributions via
						extension
						points to the application model.
					
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					
						Removing the usage of Singleton objects from the Eclipse platform,
						e.g.
						<code>Platform</code>
						or
						<code>PlatformUI</code>
						and use
						the dependency injection
						programming model.
					
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>

[[migration2">
=== Reuse of platform components
		 Most Eclipse IDE components are still based on the Eclipse 3.x
			API.
			The Eclipse platform plans to migrate more and more existing
			components
			to the Eclipse 4.x API over time. For customers this means
			that certain components which could be reused in Eclipse 3.x RCP
			application are not available by default.
		
		
			Currently most
			components, for example, the IDE perspective switcher,
			the
			view switcher,
			the
			_Progress_
			view, the new project wizard are based on the Eclipse 3.x API and
			therefore cannot be used without modifications in an Eclipse 4 RCP
			application.

			The
