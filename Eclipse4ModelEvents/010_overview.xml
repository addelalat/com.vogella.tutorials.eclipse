	<para>
		If the application model changes the Eclipse framework sends out notifications.
		The Eclipse 4 framework allows to
		notify event listeners if this happens.
	</para>

	<para>
		For example the
		<code>UIEvents.UILifeCycle.APP_STARTUP_COMPLETE</code>
		event is triggered once the application has started. Application components can register to this event and are called
		by the framework once this happens.
	</para>
	<para>Also if your application model changes like your windows, perspectives, parts and their
		containers, e.g.,
		application, perspective stacks, part
		sash container or
		part stacks, an event is propagated by the
		IEventBroker.
	</para>
	<para>
		The central class which defines the Eclipse framework events is the
		<code>UIEvents</code>
		class from the
		<code>org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench</code>
		package. It contains most of the events or topics and also helper methods to work with the
		events. This class also
		contains information
		about the purpose of events in its
		Javadoc. The Eclipse
		framework sends
		out objects of type
		<code>org.osgi.service.event.Event</code>
		.
