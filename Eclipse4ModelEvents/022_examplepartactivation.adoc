== Example: the part activation event

A topic, which is fired by Eclipse is the `UIEvents.UILifeCycle.ACTIVATE` , which is fired every time a part is activated.

[source, java]
----
include::./res/activate.java[]

The `Event` class contains properties like `EventTags.ELEMENT`, from which we can receive the element, which is concerned in this event.
But there are more and therefore you should have a look at the `UIEvents` class and its internal interfaces like `UIEvents.EventTags`.
