	<title>Example: the part activation event
	
		A topic, which is fired by Eclipse is the
		<code>UIEvents.UILifeCycle.ACTIVATE</code>
		, which is fired every time a
		part
		is activated.
	
	
		<programlisting language="java">
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/activate.java" />
		</programlisting>
	
	
		The
		<code>Event</code>
		class contains properties like
		<code>EventTags.ELEMENT</code>
		, from which we can receive the element, which is concerned
		in this event. But there are more and therefore you should
		have
		a look at the
		<code>UIEvents</code>
		class and its internal interfaces like
		<code>UIEvents.EventTags</code>
		.
