		part
		is activated.

		The
		<code>Event</code>
		class contains properties like
		<code>EventTags.ELEMENT</code>
		, from which we can receive the element, which is concerned
		in this event. But there are more and therefore you should
		have
		a look at the
		<code>UIEvents</code>
		class and its internal interfaces like
		<code>UIEvents.EventTags</code>
		.
