== Convenience methods for working with events
Besides the convenience methods for the event types, the UIEvents class offers two more convenience methods:

=== The contains method

The `contains` method can be used to check whether a certain object is part of an event's property.

Imagine you listen for changed tags on a certain model element and want to determine, if a certain tag is part of the tags of the given model element.
In this case the `contains` method helps you with that task.

An example for this can be found in the `subscribeTopicTagsChanged(Event)` method of the `ToolBarManagerRenderer` class from the Eclipse framework.

[source,java]
----
include::res/ui_events_contains_example.java[]
----

This code demonstrates how the existence of a certain tag (`IPresentationEngine.HIDDEN_EXPLICITLY`) is checked with the contains method.

=== The asIterable method

The _asIterable_ method can be used to get an `Iterable` of an event's property.

Let's take the example from <xref linkend="position_event_tag" /> , where we listened to the `UIEvents.ElementContainer.TOPIC_CHILDREN` event and checked the new position.

This sample lacks in case we add more than one child to the `MPartStack`, so that we have the `UIEvents.EventTypes.ADD_MANY` event type.
In this case nothing would be printed to the system out, because we have a list in the `EventTags.NEW_VALUE` property rather than an `MPart`.

So we need to enhance our `subscribeTopicElementContainerChildren` method like this:
