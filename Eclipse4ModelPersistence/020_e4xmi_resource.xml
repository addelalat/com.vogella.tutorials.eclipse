== Saving and restoring parts of the application model


=== Store certain model elements
		
			By default the Eclipse platform stores and restores the complete runtime application model, unless the startup
			parameter
			_clearPersistedState_
			is used. If this parameter is used, the whole user changes are deleted.
		
		
			It is possible to store
			selected
			model elements via the
			`E4XMIResourceFactory`
			class. This allows a more flexible handling of the model persistence.
		
		
			The following
			snippet shows a handler implementation, where the corresponding model elements of the active
			perspective are persisted
			in an
			xmi file.

=== Load stored model elements
		
			The previously stored xmi file can be restored by using the
			`load`
			method of the
			`Resource`
			class.
		
		
			The following snippet is an example, where a stored perspective is applied to an existing application model. In case
			an existing
			perspective with the same
			_elementId_
			as the one of the loaded
			perspective is found, it is removed. Afterwards the code adds and switches to the loaded
			perspective.
