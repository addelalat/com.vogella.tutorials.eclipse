[[modelpersistence_e4xmi_resource_save">
=== Store certain model elements
		
			By default the Eclipse platform stores and restores the complete runtime application model, unless the startup
			parameter
			<parameter>clearPersistedState</parameter>
			is used. If this parameter is used, the whole user changes are deleted.
		
		
			It is possible to store
			selected
			model elements via the
			<code>E4XMIResourceFactory</code>
			class. This allows a more flexible handling of the model persistence.
		
		
			The following
			snippet shows a handler implementation, where the corresponding model elements of the active
			perspective are persisted
			in an
			xmi file.

[[modelpersistence_e4xmi_resource_load">
=== Load stored model elements
		
			The previously stored xmi file can be restored by using the
			<code>load</code>
			method of the
			<code>Resource</code>
			class.
		
		
			The following snippet is an example, where a stored perspective is applied to an existing application model. In case
			an existing
			perspective with the same
			<parameter>elementId</parameter>
			as the one of the loaded
			perspective is found, it is removed. Afterwards the code adds and switches to the loaded
			perspective.
