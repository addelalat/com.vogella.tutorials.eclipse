	<para>Eclipse RCP applications are based on OSGi and therefore support
		the modularity concept of OSGi. To contribute to the application
		model, the Eclipse platform implements support for static and dynamic
		contributions.
	</para>

	<para>
		The initial structure of an RCP application is described via the
		application
		model in the
		<filename>Application.e4xmi</filename>
		file.
	</para>
	<para>
		Other
		plug-ins can extend this base application model with
		contributions.
		Model contributions can be statically defined in files.
		These extensions are called
		fragments
		or
		<wordasword>model fragments</wordasword>
		. Model contributions can also extend the model dynamically via code.
		These extensions are called
		<wordasword>processors</wordasword>
		or
		<wordasword>model processors</wordasword>
		.
	</para>

	<para>
		These model contributions are registered with the Eclipse framework
		via an extension point. To register your contributions you provide
		extensions to the
		<code>org.eclipse.e4.workbench.model</code>
		extension point.
	</para>
	<para>
		This extension point is defined in the
		<code>org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench</code>
		plug-in.
	</para>

	<para>
		The model contributions are read during startup and the
		contained
		information
		is used
		to build the runtime application model.
	</para>
