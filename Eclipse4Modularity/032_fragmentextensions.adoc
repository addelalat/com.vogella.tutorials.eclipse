== Fragment extension elements
	
In fragments you contribute to an existing model element which is
defined via its ID. You also have to specify the
_Featurename_
to which you want to contribute. A
_Featurename_
is a direct link to the structure of the application model.
	
The following table lists some
_Featurename_
values and their purposes.
