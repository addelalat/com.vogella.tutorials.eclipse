== Fragment extension elements
	
		In fragments you contribute to an existing model element which is
		defined via its ID. You also have to specify the
		_Featurename_
		to which you want to contribute. A
		_Featurename_
		is a direct link to the structure of the application model.
	
	
		The following table lists some
		_Featurename_
		values and their purposes.
