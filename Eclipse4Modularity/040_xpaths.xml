== XPaths in model fragments
	XPaths can also be used to define the contributing place in the model for a model fragment. The following table
		gives several examples how you can use XPath to define the model element you want to extend.

=== Sample XPaths for the Application Model
		<tgroup cols='2' align='left' colsep='1' rowsep='1'>
			<colspec colname='c1' colwidth="40%" />
			<colspec colname='c2' colwidth="60%" />
			
				
|XPath
|Element in Application Model
				
			
			
				
|/
|The slash (/) always addresses the root element of an XML
						file, which always is the MApplication element.
					
				
				
|//mainMenu
|Contribute to the main menu.
				
				
|//mainMenu/children or //mainMenu/*[1]
					
|
						Contribute to the first child of the main menu. In most
						application this would be the
						<guimenu>File</guimenu>
						menu.
					
				
				
|//mainMenu/*[@*[local-name()='type' and .='menu:Menu']]
					
|
						
							Contribute to the first Menu of the main menu. This xpath is more
							detailed than the one above since it also
							requires that the main
							menu child is of type
							_menu:Menu_
							.
						
						
							In most
							application this would be the
							<guimenu>File</guimenu>
							menu.
						
					
				
				
|//trimBars[@side="Bottom"]
|Contribute to the bottom trimbar.
				
				
|//trimBars[not(@side)]
|
						Contribute to the top trimbar. When the
						`MTrimBar`
						is on top
						the side
						attribute is omitted, therefore
						`not(@side)`
						is used.
					
				
				
|//children[@*[local-name()='type' and .='basic:Part']]
					
|
						Contribute to a
						`MPart`
						.
					
				
				
|//children[@*[local-name()='type' and
						.='basic:Part']][./tags = 'Editor']
					
|
						Contribute to a
						`MPart`
						which is tagged with the
						_Editor_
						tag.

		From these examples more useful XPaths for navigating the
		Application Model can be derived.
