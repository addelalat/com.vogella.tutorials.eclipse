== Exercise: Contributing via model fragments

=== Target

In this exercise you create a model fragment to contribute a
menu
entry, a command and a
handler to
your application model.

=== Create a new plug-in

Create a simple plug-in project called
_com.example.e4.rcp.todo.contribute_. The following description abbreviates the plug-in name to the
`contribute`
plug-in.

=== Add the dependencies

In the
`MANIFEST.MF`
file, add the following plug-ins as dependencies to your
`contribute`
plug-in.

* org.eclipse.core.runtime
* org.eclipse.swt
* org.eclipse.jface
* org.eclipse.e4.core.di
* org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench
* org.eclipse.e4.ui.di

=== Create a handler class

Create the
`com.example.e4.rcp.todo.contribute.handlers`
package and
the following class.

[source,java]
----
include::res/fragments/OpenMapHandler.java[]
----

=== Create a model fragment

Use the fragment wizard from the e4 tools project to create a new
model fragment via the following
menu:
menu:File[New > Other... > Eclipse 4 > Model > New Model Fragment].

Select the
`contribute`
plug-in as the container and use
_fragment.e4xmi_
as the name for the file.

Press the btn:[Finish] button.

=== Validate that the fragment is registered as extension

This wizard which creates the fragment also adds the
`org.eclipse.e4.workbench.model`
extension to your
`contribute`
plug-in. To review this open the
_plugin.xml_
file.

TIP: If the
_plugin.xml_
file is missing, open your
_MANIFEST.MF_
file, select the
_Overview_
tab and click on the
_Extensions_
link. This shows the
_Extensions_
tab in the editor and once you add an extension in this tab the
_plugin.xml_
file is generated.

WARNING: At the time of this writing the wizard deletes existing content
in the plugin.xml, if you create a new fragment. This is a bug and
might already be solved once you read this.

On the
_Extensions_
tab validate that you have an entry similar to the following
screenshot.

TIP: If entry in the plugin.xml is missing you can create it by clicking
on the
btn:[Add...] button and by adding add a new extension for the
`org.eclipse.e4.workbench.model`
extension point. Afterwards you the right mouse click to add a
fragment to it.

The resulting
plugin.xml
file should look similar to the following
code.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/fragments/plugin.xml[]
----

=== Adding model elements

Open the
_fragment.e4xmi_
file in its editor.
Select the
_Model Fragments_
node and
press the
btn:[Add...] button.

image::modelfragment10.png[Adding a model fragment]

Use
`com.example.e4.rcp.todo.application`
as the
_Element ID_. This is the ID of the
_Application_
model element in
your
_Application.e4xmi_
file.

WARNING: Ensure that
`com.example.e4.rcp.todo.application`
is the ID you
are using for the top node in the
_Application.e4xmi_
file. Otherwise
the
contribution does not work. This is because the
Eclipse runtime
does not find
the correct model element to contribute
to.

You
also need to
define
to which feature
you will be adding to. For
_Featurename_
, specify the value
_commands_.
Make sure you have the
_Model Fragment_
selected and
use
the
btn:[Add...] button to add a
_Command_
to your model fragment.

image::modelfragment20.png[Adding a model fragment]

Use
`com.example.e4.rcp.todo.contribute.command.openmap`
for the
_ID_
field and
`Open Map`
for the
_Name_
field.

image::fragment30.png[Adding a command to the model fragment]

Create a new model fragment for the handler. The
_Element ID_
is again your
application ID, the
_Featurename_
is
`handlers`.

Add a
_Handler_
to this model fragment.

image::fragment32.png[Adding a handler to the model fragment]

Use
`com.example.e4.rcp.todo.contribute.handler.openmap`
as ID for the handler.
Point to the
_Open Map_
command and the
`OpenMapHandler`
class.

image::fragment40.png[Adding a handler to the model fragment]

Add another
_Model Fragment_
to contribute a new menu to your application model. Contribute to
the
main menu of your
_Application.e4xmi_.
If you followed the earlier
exericses correctly this should be the
`org.eclipse.ui.main.menu`
ID. The
_Featurename_
is
`children`.

image::fragment50.png[Adding a fragment for the menu]

WARNING: Ensure in your
_Application.e4xmi_
file that you are using the
same
ID
for your menu in your application.
The following
screenshot
highlights this entry.

image::fragment52.png[Adding a fragment for the menu]

In your
_fragment.e4xmi_
file add a
_Menu_
with the
_com.example.e4.rcp.todo.contribute.menu.map_
ID and a
_Map_
label.

image::fragment60.png[Adding a menu entry]

image::fragment62.png[Adding a menu entry]

Add a
_HandledMenuItem_
which
points to
your new command. The process
of
defining these entries
is
the same as
defining menus
in the
_Application.e4xmi_
file. See
<<part_commands>>
for further information. The created entry should be similar to the
following screenshot.

image::fragment70.png[Adding a menu item to the menu]

=== Update the product configuration (via the feature)

Add the
`contribute`
plug-in to your
`com.example.e4.rcp.todo.feature`
feature.

WARNING: Ensure that you added this new plug-in to your feature and
saved the changes.

=== Validating

Start your application.

WARNING: Remember to start via the product to update the launch
configuration.

You should
see the new
_Map_
entry in the application menu. If you select
this entry a message
dialog
opens.

If the menu entry is not displayed, ensure that your IDs are
correctly
entered and that you either use the
_clearPersistedState_
flag or clear the workspace data in your
_Launch configuration_.


=== Exercise: Contributing a part

NOTE: This exercise is optional.

Define a new model fragment which
contributes a
part
to an existing
_PartStack_. Use the ID of an existing
_PartStack_
and use
`children`
as
_FeatureName_.
