== Exercise: Implementing a model processor

=== Target

In this exercise
you
replace an existing menu entry with another
menu entry.

=== Enter the dependencies

Continue to use the
`com.example.e4.rcp.todo.contribute`
plug-in for this exercise.

In the
_MANIFEST.MF_
, add the following plug-ins as dependencies to your
_contribute_
plug-in.

* `org.eclipse.e4.ui.services`
* `org.eclipse.e4.core.contexts`
* `org.eclipse.e4.ui.model.workbench`

=== Create the Java classes

Create the following dialog and handler classes. 

[source,java]
----
include::res/processors/ExitDialog.java[]
----

[source,java]
----
include::res/processors/ExitHandlerWithCheck.java[]
----

Create the model processor class. This class removes all menu
entries
which have "exit" in their ID from the menu with
the
`org.eclipse.ui.file.menu`
ID. It also adds a new entry.

[source,java]
----
include::res/processors/MenuProcessor.java[]
----

WARNING: Ensure that your menu entry labeled with "Exit" in the
_Application.e4xmi_
file, contains "exit" in its ID.

=== Register processor via extension

In your
`contribute`
plug-in register your
`processor`
via the
`org.eclipse.e4.workbench.model`
extension.

Right-click on the processor and select
menu:New[element]
. The value from the ID parameter is the ID of the model element
which is
injected
into your processor class. Use
_org.eclipse.ui.file.menu_
as
_id*_
parameter.

WARNING: This assumes that you used _org.eclipse.ui.file.menu_ as ID for your _File_ menu in the main application model.

WARNING: The ID of the element defined in the extension point must match the `@Named` value in the processor, otherwise your menu is not injected into the processor.

=== Validating

Start your application. In the model fragment exercises, the contribute plug-in was already added to your product.

Ensure that the existing _Exit_ menu entry is removed and your new menu entry with the _Another Exit_ label is added to the file menu.
