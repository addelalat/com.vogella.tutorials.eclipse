		<wordasword>Extended object suppliers</wordasword>
		do not have access to the
		<code>IEclipseContext</code>
		in which they are called. This limits them to search for objects
		independent of the current Eclipse context. But general Dependency
		Injection
		can be used inside an ExtendedObjectSupplier implementation,
		so that services like the IEventBroker, EModelService and so on can be
		injected.

	<para>
		For example preferences are implemented as
		<wordasword>extended object suppliers</wordasword>
		.
		They look for the preference values on the file system and do not
		know about the
		<code>IEclipseContext</code>
		.
