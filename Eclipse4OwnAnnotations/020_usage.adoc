== Example usage
	
An example for using your custom annotations would be the Java
Persistence API (JPA). You could create a custom
annotation for the
JPA persistence manager. The JPA persistence manager could be
injected
into the Eclipse 4 application
based on that custom annotation and a
corresponding
annotation processor.
