	<title>Example usage</title>
	<para>An example for using your custom annotations would be the Java
		Persistence API (JPA). You could create a custom
		annotation for the
		JPA persistence manager. The JPA persistence manager could be
		injected
		into the Eclipse 4 application
		based on that custom annotation and a
		corresponding
		annotation processor.
