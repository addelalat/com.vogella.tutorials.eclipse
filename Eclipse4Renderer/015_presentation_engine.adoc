== The IPresentationEngine

This `IPresentationEngine` interface contains several constants, which can be used to alternate the layout of the application.

.Some IPresentationEngine constants
|===
|Constant |Description

|STANDALONE
|Can be added as _tag_ to a `MPartStack`, so that only one single part can be shown in that stack.

|NO_AUTO_COLLAPSE
|Any `MElementContainer<T>` where the children are disposed usually collapse. For example when all parts in a part stack are closed the part stack disappears by default. If the part stack should stay, even though it is empty, the _NO_AUTO_COLLAPSE_ tag can be used.

|NO_MOVE
|When this tag is applied to an `MUIElement` it cannot be moved any more, e.g., by Drag&Drop.

|STYLE_OVERRIDE_KEY
|This constant can be used as key in a persisted state of an `MUIElement` in order to override the SWT style flag, which is passed to the widget. One example would be the removal of the trim of a `MWindow`'s `Shell` by specifying `SWT.NO_TRIM` in the persisted state.

|MAXIMIZED / MINIMIZED
|When applied to a `MPartStack` as a tag the stack will be MAXIMIZED or minimized.

[TIP]
====
All constants of the `IPresentationEngine` interface are well documented by their JavaDoc. So having a look directly in the interface will help.

The `IPresentationEngine` is also used to render any model element, which can be specified in the application model.

The running `IPresentationEngine` can be obtained by using dependency injection.

[source, java]
----
@Inject
private IPresentationEngine presentationEngine;
----

Available methods are:

A `Toolbar` widget, assuming the _com.vogella.e4.renderer.toolbar_ snippet is a MToolbar, could be populated like this:

[source, java]
----
Composite parent = // ...
MApplication app = // ...
EModelService modelService = // ...
IEclipseContext eclipseContext = // ...

ToolBar toolBar = new ToolBar(parent, SWT.NONE);
MUIElement mtoolbarSnippet = modelService.cloneSnippet(app, "com.vogella.e4.renderer.toolbar", null);
presentationEngine.createGui(mtoolbarSnippet, toolBar, eclipseContext);
