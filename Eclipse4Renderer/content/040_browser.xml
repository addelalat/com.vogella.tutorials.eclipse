== Exercise: A custom part renderer
	In this exercise you create a custom part renderer which renders
		all parts with an SWT
		browser widget.
	
	<warning>
		This example might not work on Linux, as the SWT browser widget
			sometimes has issues on Linux.
		
	
	
[source,java]
----
include::res/browser/MyPartRenderer.java[]
----
	
	
		Extend the
		`MyRendererFactory`
		to the following to use your own part renderer.
	

	
[source,java]
----
include::res/browser/MyRendererFactory.java[]
----
	

	Run your application and test that every part is now rendered as
		browser.
	
	NOTE:
		Currently all parts show the same URL, but you could extend your
			renderer to access for example tags at the parts to determine the
			URLs which should be used.

			After finishing the test, remove the
			`rendererFactoryUri`
			property from the
			_plugin.xml_
			file of your application plug-in, so that your application works
			again as before.
