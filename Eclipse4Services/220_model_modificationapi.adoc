== Application model modifications at runtime

=== Creating model elements
(((Application model, Runtime modification)))

As the application model is interactive, you can change it at runtime.
For example you can add parts to your application or remove menu entries.

To add your new model elements to the application you can use the model service or get existing elements injected.

=== Modifying existing model elements

You can also access existing model elements, via the model service or via dependency injection and adjust their attributes.

The Eclipse framework automatically keeps track of the application model and changes in the model are reflected immediately in your application.

For example, if you add a new window to your application, it becomes visible instantly.
Or if you inject an MPart object and call its `setLabel()` method, the text of the part in a `PartStack` changes immediately.
