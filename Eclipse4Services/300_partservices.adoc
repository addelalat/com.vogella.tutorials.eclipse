== Part service and editor like behavior

=== What is the part service?

The _part service_ allows you to find and perform actions on parts in the application model.

It also allows you to switch perspectives and to create and activate new parts based on part descriptors in the application model.

=== How to access the part service

Use dependency injection to get access to the part service.
For example via the `@Inject EPartService partService;` statement.

=== Example: Showing and hiding parts

The following example shows how you can find parts, hide or show them.
If the _Visible_ attribute of the part was initially set to `false` (not visible), you need to call the `setVisible(true)` method of the model element to ensure that the part gets displayed.

=== Example: Switching perspectives

The following example shows how you can switch to another perspective with the part service.

=== Using part descriptors

The _part descriptor_ model element is a template for the creation of a part. 
By defining a common set of attributes via such a blueprint it is possible to create concrete instances of it via the part service.

Via the _Multiple_ of the part descriptor you configure if multiple instances of this part can be created or not.
Such a model element is depicted in the following screenshot.

=== Example: Part descriptors and creating parts dynamically

If you define a part descriptor in your application model, you can use the `EPartService` to create a part from it.

The following screenshot shows the definition of a part descriptor in the application model.
As the _Multiple_ parameter is set, it is possible to create several parts based on this template.

The part service allows you to create a new part based on this template.
This is demonstrated by the following example code.
