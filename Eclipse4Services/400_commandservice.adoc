== Command and Handler service

=== Purpose of the command and handler service

The command and handler services provide the functionality to work with commands and handlers.

Via the handler service you can create, activate and trigger handlers based on commands.
The command service allows you to access, and configure commands, i.e. by setting the parameters.

=== Access to command and handler service

You can use dependency injection to access the services.
The relevant interfaces are `ECommandService` and `EHandlerService`.

=== Example for executing a command
