=== What are Eclipse platform services?

		<indexterm>
			<primary>Eclipse services</primary>
		</indexterm>

		Services are software
			components (based on an interface or a
			class)
			which provide functionality.
			The
			Eclipse platform defines several
			services.
			The classes which are created based on the application model
			can access these services via
			dependency
			injection.
		

		
			To use an Eclipse service you
			specify
			the service dependency via an
			<code>@Inject</code>
			annotation and the Eclipse framework injects this component into
			your
			object.
		
		
			The typical naming convention for Eclipse service interfaces is to
			start
			with an
			_E_
			and end with
			_Service_
			e.g.
			_E*Service_
			.

[[platformservice_implementation">
    <title>How are Eclipse platform services implemented?
    
        Usually services
        have two parts: the interface definition and the
        implementation. How these two
        are linked
        is defined by a
        context function, an
        OSGi service or plain context
        value
        setting (
        <code>IEclipseContext</code>
        ). Please note that there can be more than one service
        implementation
        for an interface.
