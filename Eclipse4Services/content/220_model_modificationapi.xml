		<para> As the
			application model is interactive, you
			can change it at
			runtime.
			For
			example you can add
			parts
			to your
			application
			or remove menu
			entries.
		</para>
		<para>To add your new model elements to the application you can use
			the model service or get existing elements injected.

		<para>You can also access existing model elements, via the model
			service or via dependency injection and adjust their attributes.
		</para>
		<para>
			The Eclipse framework automatically keeps track of the
			application
			model and changes in the model are reflected immediately
			in your
			application.
		</para>
		<para>
			For example, if you add a new window to your
			application, it becomes
			visible instantly.
			Or if you inject an MPart object and call its
			<code>setLabel()</code>
			method, the text of the part in a
			<code>PartStack</code>
			changes immediately.
