== Example for changing the application model


=== Example: Search for a perspective and change its attributes
		
			The following code shows how to access a
			`PartSashContainer`
			with the
			`mypartsashcontainer`
			ID. It also demonstrates how to modify model attributes.
		
		
			In this
			example it changes the
			<parameter>container data</parameter>
			parameter for its children. This will
			arrange (layout) the
			parts
			in the container.
		
		
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="../examples/emodelservice/layoutingPerspective.java" />
			</programlisting>
		


	


=== Example: Dynamically create a new window
		
			To create new model objects you can use the
			`createModelElement()`
			of the model service. After you created such an object you can add it
			to your application model at runtime.

		
		
			For example, the creation of a new window for a running
			application is demonstrated by the following code snippet.
		
		
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="../examples/model/addWindow.java" />
			</programlisting>
		
	

=== Example: Dynamically create a new part

		 The following code demonstrates how to create and add a new
			part to the currently
			active window.
		
		
			<programlisting>
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="../examples/model/AddPartHandler.java" />
			</programlisting>
		
		<tip>
			
				Typically you would add the part to a pre-defined
				`PartStack`
				. Use the model service to search for the correct one.
