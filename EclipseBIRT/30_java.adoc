== Java classes
	
The report will display stock data. To demonstrate BIRT we use a
Mock object for
providing the data.
	
Create
package _de.vogella.birt.stocks.model_ and then the
following
class. This class will represent the domain model.

include::res/model/StockData.java[]

Create the package _de.vogella.birt.stocks.daomock_ and then the
following class _StockDaoMock_. This will only mock / fake the data
and not really get it from the Internet. As we want to learn BIRT here
this should be fine.
