== Datasource and Dataset

To use Java Objects (POJO's) as datasource in Eclipse BIRT you
have to map the fields of your Java classes to
JavaScript. This
JavaScript is used in your report and will access the Java
Object.

=== Create Data Source

The data source connects your data with your report. BIRT
provides different types of data sources, we use the "Scripted Data
Source". Go back to your stocks_report, use the "Report Design"
perspective and select the "Data Explorer" View.

TIP: You have to select your report to display the content of the datasource view.

Create a new datasource, named "srcStocks" in your report.

=== The Dataset

The dataset defines the mapping for the datasource data and the
BIRT data. Create a new dataset named "dataSetSocks".

=== JavaScript

Now we have to write the JavaScript for our dataset. Select the dataset and
choose "open" as script. The open script is called before the first
access to the dataset. We use this to load our List with the stock
objects. To access a Java class you only have to use the following
syntax: Packages.myJavaClass where myJavaClass is the full qualified
Java class name.

TIP: In case you do not see the script please node that the editor for the report has several tab. One of it is labeled "source".

Place the following coding in the fetch script.

Check if your Script works by doubleclicking
on the dataset -> Preview Result.
