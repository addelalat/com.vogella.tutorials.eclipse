== Eclipse BIRT

=== Overview
		 Eclipse BIRT allows the creation of reports based on data from
			different data
			sources. Data sources define where the data is
			stored.
		
		
			BIRT provides for example the following data sources:
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					Databases (via JDBC)
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					Text Files (cvs, XML)
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					WebServices (via WSDL-Files)
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					Scripting Data sources
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
		
		 You use in BIRT "Data sets" to
			defines queries on data source. These data sets can be used in a report.
		
		 In a Java program it is often convenient to use Java
			objects as
			a data source for reports. This article will focus on the
			usage of
			Plain Old Java Objects (POJO) as data sources for BIRT
			reports.
		
	

=== Example
		
			In this tutorial we will build a report which will show us
			information about the stock market. We get the information from a
			Java Object. The data will be displayed in a chart and in a table
			with detailed information. The result should look like this:

				</imageobject>
			</mediaobject>
