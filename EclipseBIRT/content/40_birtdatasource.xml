== Datasource and Dataset
	To use Java Objects (POJO's) as datasource in Eclipse BIRT you
		have to map the fields of your Java classes to
		JavaScript. This
		JavaScript is used in your report and will access the Java
		Object.

=== Create Data Source
		 The data source connects your data with your report. BIRT
			provides different types of data sources, we use the "Scripted Data
			Source". Go back to your stocks_report, use the "Report Design"
			perspective and select the "Data Explorer" View.
		
			<tip> You have to select your report to display the content of the
				datasource view.</tip>
		
		
			Create a new datasource, named "srcStocks" in your report.

=== The Dataset
		
			The dataset defines the mapping for the datasource data and the
			BIRT data. 	Create a new dataset named "dataSetSocks".

			Press next and define the columns for your report.

=== JavaScript
		 Now we have to write the JavaScript for our dataset. Select the dataset and
			choose "open" as script. The open script is called before the first
			access to the dataset. We use this to load our List with the stock
			objects. To access a Java class you only have to use the following
			syntax: Packages.myJavaClass where myJavaClass is the full qualified
			Java class name.
		
			<tip> In case you do not see the script please node that the editor
				for the report has several tab. One of it is labeled "source".</tip>

				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="../examples/javascript/open.script" />
			</programlisting>
		
		 Place the following coding in the fetch script.
		
		
			<programlisting>
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="../examples/javascript/fetch.script" />
			</programlisting>
		
		 Check if your Script works by doubleclicking
			on the dataset -> Preview Result.
