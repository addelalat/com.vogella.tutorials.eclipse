	<title>Eclipse Builder
	 Eclipse supports the concept of natures and builders. For each
		project you can register a nature for which you can associate a
		certain builder. A builder is an object that manipulates your
		resources in your Eclipse IDE and creates other resources. 
	

	 For example the "Java Builder" is used to translate Java Source
		files into .class files. 
	 You can create your own builders by implementing the extension
		point "org.eclipse.core.resources.builders".
	Each builder is subclassed from "IncrementalProjectBuilder" and
		must implement the method build().
	In case autobuild is active then this method is called from the
		eclipse Framework if resources are
		changed. The method is also called
		if the user selects "Clean", "Build" or "Build All" from the menu.
	
	 Builder are included in the file ".project" in the buildCommands
		tag. 
	 The method build() get a parameter if a full build (FULL_BUILD)
		or a delta build (INCREMENTAL_BUILD) has to be done. To get the
		changes in case of a delta build you can use the
		getDelta(getProject() call which returns a "IResourceDelta".

	 For more information on builders please see the article in the
		appendix.
