== Binary import of plug-ins

The following describes how you can import the source code of Eclipse plug-ins from your Eclipse installation to review the code.
The Eclipse standard distribution contains the source code for the core Eclipse project.
For other Eclipse projects you usually find an "SDK" bundle on the project update site which contains the source code.

To avoid "pollution" of your existing workspace, switch to a new workspace and select

menu:File[Import]

Select btn:[Plug-ins and Fragments].

Make the following settings.
Select _Binary project_.
There you can read the source code, but you cannot change it.
It will also not be compiled.
Therefore, this setting will save memory and performance.
