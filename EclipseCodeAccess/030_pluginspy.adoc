=== SWT Spy

_SWT Spy_ for Eclipse is a tool that prints out information about the widget under the cursor.
Currently, this includes style, layout and parent information.
See http://www.eclipse.org/swt/tools.php[SWT Development Tools homepage] for more information.

=== Layout Spy

With Eclipse 4.7 PDE has added the SWT Layout Spy.
Press kbd:[Ctrl + Alt + Shift + F9] on any window to activate it.

Press `Select Control` to pick a control to inspect.
With `Show Overlay` you activate an overlay that shows an outline around the selected control (red rectangle) and its child (yellow rectangle).
You can navigate the controls with `Open Child` and `Open Parent`.

To find a control which boundary is misaligned now navigate to a control thats outline is correct but its child isn't.
Check the value of computeSize. If the result of computeSize is correct, the problem is in the parent layout or its attributes. Otherwise the problem is in the child widget.
