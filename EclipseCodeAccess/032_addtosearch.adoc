== Enable access to plug-ins

=== Filtering by the Java tools

The Eclipse Java tools limit the scope of search related activities based on your projects.
By default, Eclipse includes elements from opened projects including their dependencies as well as elements from the standard Java library.

For example, the Open Type dialog (kbd:[Ctrl + Shift + T]) does not find the `ISources` interface, if it is not referred to by project in your workspace. 

As plug-in developer you want to have access to all classes in your current _target platform_.
The _target platform_ is the set of plug-ins against you develop.
By default, the plug-ins from the Eclipse IDE installation are used as target platform.

=== Include all plug-ins in Java search

You can include all classes from the current target platform to be relevant for the Eclipse Java tools via the following setting: 
menu:Window[Preferences > Plug-in Development > Include all plug-ins from target in Java search]
