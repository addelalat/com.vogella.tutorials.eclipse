=== Plain text search

In case you have imported the source code of an Eclipse project into your workspace you can also use the plain text search.
Select the menu:Search[Search] menu entry and switch to the _File Search_ tab.

As indicated in the following screenshot you can search for a text, use regular expressions and restrict which files to search by specifying a file name pattern.
This is a very flexible way to search and allows you to find almost everything.
