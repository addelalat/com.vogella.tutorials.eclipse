== Defining the command usage in the UI

=== Menu extension points
		
The
`org.eclipse.ui.menu`
extension point is used to define where the command is visible in the
application, e.g., you could define that the command is visible in the
application menu or in a
view
menu.

The
_menuContribution_
contribution has an ID value which allow to identify the
contribution.
		
_menuContribution_
has an
_locationURI_
attribute which allows to
define where in the user interface a
command
is displayed. This different attribute values are summarized in the
following table.

=== Defining the position of a menu extension
		
Frequently you want to position a new command behind or before
another command. For example the 
_Save All_
menu entry should be positioned after the
_Save_
menu entry.
		
You can define the relative position of a command in this
locationURI
by using the
pattern
_?before=ID_
or
_?after=ID_
.
		
The ID
can
be an existing separator
name,
menu ID, or item ID. The
command will
then be placed before or
after
the element with the
corresponding ID.
		
		
For example if you want to add
a command to an
existing menu with
the
_fileMenu_
ID behind the menu
entry with the
_oneEntry_
ID use the
_menu:fileMenu?after=oneEntry_
locationURI .
