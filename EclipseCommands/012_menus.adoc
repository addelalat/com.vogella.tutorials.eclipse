=== Defining the position of a menu extension
		
Can you also define the position of a command.
For example, the  _Save All_ menu entry should be positioned after the _Save_ menu entry.
		
You can define the relative position of a command in this locationURI by using the pattern _?before=ID_ or _?after=ID_.
		
The ID can be an existing separator name, menu ID, or item ID. 
The command is placed before or after the element with the corresponding ID.
		
		
For example, to place a command in the _fileMenu_ menu behind the _oneEntry_ menu entry, use the _menu:fileMenu?after=oneEntry_
locationURI.
