Create a new command by right-click on your extension point
and by selecting New -> command.
	
TIP: If you only see an "Generic" entry you most likely have not downloaded "Eclipse for RCP/Plug-in Developers". Please see

Set the ID to "de.vogella.rcp.commands.first.commands.Exit" and
the name to "Exit". Enter the class

defaultHandler.

Press the hyperlink "defaultHandler" to create the
class which should extend "org.eclipse.core.commands.AbstractHandler".
	
	
[source,java]
----
include::res/commands/ExitHandler.java[]

=== Using commands in menus

The command which we defined should be used in a
menu. Add a extension
to the
`org.eclipse.ui.menus`
extension point.
Right-click on the
extension point and select
menu:New[menuContribution].

Create a new menu contribution with the
"menu:org.eclipse.ui.main.menu" locationURI. Make sure this URL is
correct spelled,
otherwise your menu will not be shown.

Right-click your menucontribution and select
menu:New[Menu].
Add a
menu with the "File" label and the "fileMenu" ID.

Select your menu, right-click on it, select New->
Command.
Maintain your commandID. Set the label
to
"Exit" and the tooltip to
"Exits the application".

This should result in a `plugin.xml` file which looks like
the
following.
	
[source,xml]
----
include::res/commands/pluginfileexit.xml[]
----
	
Run the example. 
You should see menu with the file and if you select the "Exit" entry you application should exit.
