	Eclipse IDE extensions use the commands framework to
		contribute
		actions to the user interface. This concept is based on
		extension
		points.

		extensions. To define and use a command you have to define three
		extensions.
		The following extension points are relevant to define a
		menu
		or toolbar
		contribution for an Eclipse plug-in.
