[[commands_overview">
=== What are commands?
		
			A command in Eclipse is a declarative description of a
			component
			and
			is
			independent from the implementation details.
		

		
			A
			command can be
			categorized, assigned
			to
			the user
			interface and a
			key
			binding can be defined for the
			command.
			The behavior
			of a command is
			defined via a handler.
