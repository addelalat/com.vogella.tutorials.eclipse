			The

			extension point connects the command to a certain class which is
			called once the command is executed.
		</para>
		<para>
			The behavior of a command is
			defined via
			handlers. The handler is
			the
			class which is executed once the command is
			called and must
			implement
			the
			<code>IHandler</code>
			interface from the
			<code>org.eclipse.core.commands</code>
			package.
		</para>
		<para>
			In most cases you extend the
			<code>org.eclipse.core.commands.AbstractHandler</code>
			class which
			provides a
			default
			implementation for the
			<code>IHandler</code>
			interface.
		</para>
		<para>
			The
			<code>execute()</code>
			method is called if the handler is executed.
		</para>
		<para>
			In the
			<code>execute()</code>
			method you get access to frequently used values
			and services via the
			<code>HandlerUtil</code>
			class.

			Handler can be defined with conditions (activeWhen) under which
			define the conditions under which
			the handlers are valid for a
			command.
			You can define
			several
			handlers for a
			command

			certain point.
			Otherwise the Eclipse runtime
			will not enabled the command.
