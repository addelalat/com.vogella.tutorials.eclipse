== Tutorial: Commands and context menus
	
		In this example you add a context menu to a SWT table widget.
		Create a
		new project
		called
		_de.vogella.rcp.intro.commands.popup_
		based on the
		"RCP
		application
		with a view" example.
	
	
		Create a new command with the
		`de.vogella.rcp.intro.commands.popup.showSelected`
		ID
		and the name
		_Show_
		.
	
	
		In this example we will not use the default handler. Therefore
		add the
		`org.eclipse.ui.handlers`
		extension point
		to your plugin.xml file
		and add a handler. The first
		parameter is the
		commandId and the
		second
		the class for
		the handler. Use
		`de.vogella.rcp.intro.commands.popup.handler.ShowSelected`
		as class name.

	 Implement now the code for your handler. I just print the
		selected elements to the console.
	
	
		<programlisting>
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text"
				href="../examples/contextmenu/ShowSelectedHandler.java[]
----
	
	Add a new menuContribution with the locationURI
		"popup:de.vogella.rcp.intro.commands.popup.view", where
		"de.vogella.rcp.intro.commands.popup.view" is the ID of your view
		which has been automatically created for you.
	
	Right-click your new menuContribution and select New ->
		Command.
		Assign your command to the field "commandId".
		Label it "One
		Item
		selected".
	
	
		Now you have add a MenuManager to your view. Select the
		`View`
		class and change it to the following.
	
	
		<programlisting>
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="../examples/contextmenu/change10.java[]
----
	
	 Run your application. If you perform a right-click on the table, your menu
		should become
		visible. If you select it
		menu then the names of the
		selected items
		should be written to the console.
