[[standardcommands_overview">
=== Overview
		 Eclipse provides lots of standard commands which you can
			reuse.
			Just press on the "Browse button" while defining your
			commandId to see
			the available standard commands. For example the
			screenshot shows the
			usage of the standard about dialog command.
		

		 The advantage of using standard commands is that you get the
			keybinding, icons, etc for free.

			<tip> Standard commands sometimes map to actions which are
				contributed
				via ActionFactory in the class
				ApplicationActionBarAdvisor. If the
				ActionFactory returns an IAction
				you need to register this action.
				If
				not these commands are inactive
				in your menu. For example the
				following made the reset perspective
				and welcome command active.

[[standardcommands_example">
=== Example
		
			You can also use standard command and define a new handler for
			this
			command, e.g., you can use the standard Eclipse delete command
			(org.eclipse.ui.edit.delete). 
		

		
			<tip>
				To find the id of existing commands you
				can you the

			</tip>
		


		 You can use the extension point "org.eclipse.ui.handlers"
			to define new handlers for the standard commands. 
			

		
			<tip>
				Eclipse requires
				you to have only one active handler at the time
				therefore you have to
				use the "activeWhen" restriction on the handler
				to make it more
				special then the standard binding. To use for example
				delete in several views with different handlers use "activeWhen"
				with the variable "activePartId" and as the value your view id.
			</tip>
		

		 Create a new RCP application
			"de.vogella.rcp.commands.standardcommands" with the template "Hello
			RCP". 
		 Create a handler for the command "org.eclipse.ui.edit.delete"
			which display a message box. Add the command
			"org.eclipse.ui.edit.delete" to the menu.
