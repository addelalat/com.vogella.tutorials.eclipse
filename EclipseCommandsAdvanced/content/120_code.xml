== Calling commands directly via code
	 You can call a command directly. For example if you have a
		command "add.command" defined you can call it via the following
		coding.
	
	
		<programlisting>
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
				parse="text" href="../examples/button/button.java[]
----
	
	 The code above is called within a view which provides access
		to the site and to services. You can also get the service via the
		WorkbenchWindow.
