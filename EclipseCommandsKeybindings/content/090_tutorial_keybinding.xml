== Tutorial: Defining key bindings for Commands

=== Keybinding using the default scheme
		 Create a new project "de.vogella.rcp.intro.commands.keybinding"
			using the "Hello RCP" template, declare command
			"de.vogella.rcp.intro.commands.keybinding.hello" with a default
			handler "de.vogella.rcp.intro.commands.keybinding.HelloHandler" which
			prints out "Hello" to the console
		 Add the extension point "org.eclipse.ui.bindings" to your
			project. Right-click in this extension point, select New-> Key.
		
		 Select as schemeID
			"org.eclipse.ui.defaultAcceleratorConfiguration" this is the
			workbench default and will make sure you keybinding is valid in the
			whole application. The commandId is the ID of the command you just
			created. The sequence is the shortcut key for calling the command. M1
			represents the Ctrl key.

		 If you now run it the keybinding should work and if you press
			Ctrll+1 the message on the console should be visible.
	

=== Defining your own scheme
		 Add now another key binding "Ctrl+N" to the command
			"de.vogella.rcp.intro.commands.keybinding.hello". Try it. This will
			not work as it is conflicting with the Eclipse default schema.
		 Right-click in this extension point "org.eclipse.ui.bindings",
			select New-> Scheme. Create a schema with the id "MyScheme".

			Define a product. See
http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/RichClientPlatform/article.html#product">
				Defining a product for Eclipse RCP
			for details. Create the following file "plugin_customization.ini" and put it
			in your main directory
		
			<programlisting>
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="../examples/keybinding/plugin_customization.ini[]
----

		If you now run your product the "Ctrl+N" shortcut should work.
