[[commmands_sourceprovider]]
== Providing your own expression

	 You can write your own Java class which can be used define a
		variable which can then be used to define if a certain UI element
		shall be active or not. For example you can read the authorization of
		the user from your own class and then return the value which is assign
		to the user. This return value can then be used in a visible / enabled
		statement. This is similar to the usage of the core expressions we
		have seen earlier.

	 Create a RCP application
		"de.vogella.rcp.commands.sourceprovider" with the template "Hello
		RCP". 

	We will create a source provider. This source provider can
		provide variables which can be used in defining the visibility of
		commands. Add the extension point "org.eclipse.ui.services" to your
	 plug-in and create a new service provider.

This defines a service which provides the variable "de.vogella.rcp.commands.sourceprovider.active" to the workbench.
This class must implement ISourceProvider.
This value can then be used similar to a core expression.
Maintain the following code.

[source, java]
----
include::res/sourceprovider/CommandState.java[]
----

	 Create two commands
		"de.vogella.rcp.commands.sourceprovider.command1" and
		"de.vogella.rcp.commands.sourceprovider.command2". Create any handler
		you want for the first command. Command2 will be used to change the
		state in our ISourceProvider. Maintain the following code for the
		handler.
	
[source, java]
----
include::res/sourceprovider/Command2.java[]
----

Add both commands to the menu.
Now use the state provided by your ISourceProvider in your declaration of your menu.

This looks in plugin.xml like the following.

[source, java]
----
include::res/sourceprovider/plugin.txt[]
----

If you now start your application can select the second command the first command will not be available anymore.
If you press it again the first command will be displayed again.
