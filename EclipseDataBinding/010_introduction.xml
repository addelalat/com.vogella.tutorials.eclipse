== Data binding with JFace



=== Using JFace data binding
		<indexterm>
			<primary>Data binding</primary>
			<seealso>JFace data binding</seealso>
		</indexterm>

		

		
			The
			_JFace data binding_
			framework allows to synchronize changes in
			properties of
			objects. Validation and conversion
			during
			the
			synchronization
			process is supported.
		

		
			For example you could bind the String property called
			<property>firstName</property>
			of
			a
			Java object to a
			<property>text</property>
			property of the
			SWT
			`Text`
			widget. If the user changes the text in the user interface, the
			corresponding
			property in the Java object is updated.
		

		
			To observe changes in an attribute of a Java object, a
			data
			binding framework needs
			to be able to register itself
			as a
			listener to
			this
			attribute.
			JFace data binding provides API to register to changes in SWT widgets and JFace UI elements.
			Other Java object must
			implement this support. For example you can implement
			`PropertyChangeSupport`
			according to the Java
			Bean specification in these Java elements. Or you can use
			the
			`WritableValue`
			interface from JFace
			inside the model.
		
		
			The
			`IObservableValue`
			interface is the basis for
			observing properties in JFace.
			The
			<property>Properties API</property>
			provides factories to create
			`IObservableValue`
			objects.
			The main factories are to created instances of
			`IObservableValue`
			are listed in the following table.

|Factory
|Description
						
					
					
						
|
								`PojoProperties`
							
|
								Used to create
								`IObservableValue`
								for Java objects. The term Pojo (Plain old Java object) is used to describe a Java object which
								does
								not implement
								a
								specific framework API.
							
						
						
|
								`BeanProperties`
							
|
								Used for Java Beans. A Java Bean is a Java object which follows the Java Bean
								specification. This specification
								requires that the class
								implements
								`getter`
								and
								`setter`
								methods for all its attributes. It must also
								implement
								property change
								support via the
								`PropertyChangeSupport`
								class and propagate changes to registered listeners.
							
						
						
|
								`WidgetProperties`
							
|
								Used for properties of
								SWT
								widgets.
							
						
						
|
								`ViewerProperties`
							
|
								Used for properties of
								JFace Viewer.
							
						
						
|
								`Properties`
							
|
								Used for properties of non specialized types, like Objects, Collections or Maps.
							
						
						
|
								`Observables`
							
|
								Used for properties of special Objects, Collections, Maps
								and Entries of an IObservableMap.

			The following code demonstrates how to create an
			`IObservableValue`
			object
			for the
			<property>firstName</property>
			property of a Java object called
			<property>person</property>
			.

=== JFace data binding and generics
		
			In Eclipse 4.6 the data binding framework has been partially generified. This work is planned to be finished in
			4.7.
			Currently you need to use
			`@SuppressWarnings("unchecked")`
			sometimes in your data binding code to avoid compiler warnings.
		
	

=== Example for a Java bean implementation
		
		

		
			A Java class which provides
			`PropertyChangeSupport`
			looks
			like the following example.
		

		
[source,java]
----
include::res/beans/ModelObject.java[]
----
		
		Other domain classes could extend this class. The following
			example demonstrates that.
		
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/beans/Person.java[]

=== Using JFaces WritableValue class to track changes
		
			If you are able to use JFace API in your domain model, you can use
			`WritableValue`
			to provide the option to track values.

=== Data binding and Java objects without change notification
		
		
			If you connect two properties and one of these properties cannot be observed, you
			you
			can
			still
			use data binding for a
			uni-directional binding.
			For example, you can connect the
			_text_
			property of a SWT
			`Text`
			field to the
			_summary_
			field of a
			`Todo`
			object, even if Todo cannot be observed.
			In this case, updates in the summary of the
			`Todo`
			object will not update the
			`Text`
			widget. But relevant change in the
			`Text`
			widget
			user interface will update the
			`Todo`
			property.
