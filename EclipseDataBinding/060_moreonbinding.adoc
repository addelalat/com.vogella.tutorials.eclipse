== More on bindings

=== ControlDecorators
(((JFace Data Binding,ControlDecorators)))
JFace Data Binding allows you to use icon decorators in
the user
interface which reflect the status of the field
validation. This
allows you to provide immediate feedback to the user. For the
creation of the control decoration you use the return object from the
`bindvalue()`
method of
`DataBindingContext`
object.

----
include::res/snippets/decorations.java[]

The result might look like the following screenshot.

=== Binding values of a radio button group
		
When using radio buttons each button usually represents a certain
value. In order to
bind the value according to the selected state in a
radio button group, the
`SelectObservableValue`
class is the right choice.
		
The following example shows how to bind the currently selected radio
value to a
`Label`.
		
[source,java]

include::res/snippets/SelectObservableValue.java[]

The result of this snippet, should look like this:

=== Listening to all changes in the binding
(((JFace Data Binding,Listener)))
You can register a listener to all bindings of the
`DataBindingContext`
class. Your listener will be called when something has changed.
		
For example this can be used to determine the status of a
part
which
behaves like an
editor. If its data model changes, this editor
marks itself as dirty.

=== Placeholder binding with WritableValue
(((JFace Data Binding,WritableValue)))
You can create bindings to a
`WritableValue`
object.
A
`WritableValue`
object
can
hold a reference to another object.
		
You can exchange this reference in
`WritableValue`
and the databinding will use the new (reference) object for its
binding.
This way you can create the binding once and still exchange
the object
which is bound by databinding.
		
To bind to a
`WritableValue`
you use the
`observeDetail()`
method,
to inform the framework that you would like to observe
the
contained
object.

=== ComputedValue and observable trackers
		
A
`ComputedValue`
provides an abstract
`calculate`
method, which is able to compute a
value from observable trackers,
which are referenced in it's
`calculate`
method.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/computedvalue/ComputedValuePersonNameImpl.java[]
----
		
Since Eclipse Neon a new
`create`
method has been introduced, which accepts a Supplier that contains
the actual implementation of the calculate method.
		
So there's no need any more to derive from
`ComputedValue`.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/computedvalue/ComputedValuePersonNameCreate.java[]
----
		
So basically ComputedValue can easily combine different
observables and is recomputed every time one of the tracked getter
are touched.
		
A really popular example of a
`ComputedValue`
implementation is the
`AggregateValidationStatus`
, which keeps track of all validation statuses, which have been
passed to it and aggregates them to one MultiStatus or just returns
the one with maximum severity.
		
It is also a great alternative to converter implementations. For
instance the previously described
`AggregateValidationStatus`
returns an
`IStatus`
as value, but if this should be bound to the enable state of a
btn:[Finish] button, having a boolean value would be necessary.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/computedvalue/ComputedValueButtonValidationEnablement.java[]
----
		
Applying an IConverter to convert from IStatus to boolean would
be far more overhead.
