== Data Binding with SWT controls

=== First example
		
			Create a new
			Eclipse RCP
			project "de.vogella.databinding.example"
			using the template "RCP
			application with a View".
		

		
			Create the
			`de.vogella.databinding.person.model`
			package and the
			following model classes.
		
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/model/Person.java[]
----
		
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/model/Address.java[]
----
		
		
			Add the JFace Data Binding plug-ins as dependency to your
			plug-in.

		
		
			Change the
			`View`
			class to the following.
		
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/person/View.java[]
----
		

		 Run the example and test it. Each time you change the UI
			element
			then model changes automatically. If you change the model
			then
			the UI
			will also update. Try to input something else then a number iN
			the age
			field you will get an error symbol in the UI and if the mouse
			hovers
			over the symbol you see the error message.
		
	

=== More Customer Validations and ControlDecoration

		
			The following extends the example with the usage of
			_Validators_
			and
			_Decorators_
			.
		
		
			In this example the
			_Validators_
			ensures that the firstName has at
			least 2
			characters. A new
			label
			displays the
			validation status via a
			_Decorator_
			.
