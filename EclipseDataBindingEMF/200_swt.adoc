== EMF and Data Binding for SWT controls

Create an RCP project called
_de.vogella.databinding.emf.swt_
based on
the
_RCP application with a view_
. Add the
`org.eclipse.emf.ecore`
and the JFace data binding plug-ins
as a
plug-in dependency.


Create an EMF model called
_person.ecore_
. Create a class called
_Phone_
with the
_number_
property. Create also a
class called
_Person_
which
should have the
following
properties:

* firstName - String    
* lastName - String   
* gender - String      
* isMarried - boolean    
* phone - Phone    

The result should look similar to the following.

class according to the following listing. The code demonstrates
how
