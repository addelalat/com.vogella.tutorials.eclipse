== EMF and Data Binding for SWT controls
	
		Create an RCP project called
		_de.vogella.databinding.emf.swt_
		based on
		the
		_RCP
			application with a view
		_
		. Add the
		`org.eclipse.emf.ecore`
		and the JFace data binding plug-ins
		as a
		plug-in dependency.
	
	
		Create an EMF model called
		_person.ecore_
		. Create a class called
		_Phone_
		with the
		_number_
		property. Create also a
		class called
		_Person_
		which
		should have the
		following
		properties:

		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				firstName - String    
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				lastName - String   
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				gender - String      
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				isMarried - boolean    
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				phone - Phone    
			</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
	
	 The result should look similar to the following.

		</mediaobject>
	
	
		Change the
		`View`
		class according to the following listing. The code demonstrates
		how
		you can use
		_Data Binding_
		to access model properties. It also
		demonstrates how to
		access nestled
		properties to the phone class with
		is part
		of person.
