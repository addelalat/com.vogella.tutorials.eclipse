=== Prerequisites for this tutorial

This tutorial assumes that you have basic understanding of
development
for the Eclipse platform.
Please see
http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseRCP/article.html[Eclipse RCP tutorial]
or
http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipsePlugin/article.html[Eclipse Plug-in tutorial]
if you need any basic information.

In addition to the basics another requirement is the
http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseLauncherFramework/article.html[Defining custom launcher for the Eclipse IDE tutorial], 
which should be read beforehand.

=== Eclipse Debug Model

The Eclipse Debug Model is represented by a hierarchy of model
interfaces, which are visualized by a the
_Debug_
and
_Variables_
view, which can usually be found in the Debug perspective of the
Eclipse IDE.

Every debug model element is derived from
`org.eclipse.debug.core.model.IDebugElement`
interface.

* `org.eclipse.debug.core.model.IDebugTarget`
* `org.eclipse.debug.core.model.IThread`
* `org.eclipse.debug.core.model.IStackFrame`
* `org.eclipse.debug.core.model.IVariable`
* `org.eclipse.debug.core.model.IValue`

NOTE: The debug framework also offers an abstract
`org.eclipse.debug.core.model.DebugElement`
class as default implementation of
`IDebugElement`
interface, which should should be used for implementing these custom
debug model elements.

=== Debug Model Communication

The Debug Model Communication is based on events, due to the
asynchronous nature of the communication between the model and the
interpreter.

For example the
`IDebugTarget`
implements the
`org.eclipse.debug.core.model.ISuspendResume`
interface with method like
`suspend()`
and
`resume()`, which are called synchronously, but are immediately returned. So
the actual result comes back asynchronously by sending an
`org.eclipse.debug.core.DebugEvent`.

Also custom events may be fired asynchronously, as long as this
is
done in
different threads so that the UI won't be blocked. But for
convenience the
`org.eclipse.debug.core.DebugEvent`
objects should be used by deriving the debug model elements from
`org.eclipse.debug.core.model.DebugElement`, which offers default implementations for firing
`DebugEvents`.

=== Attach the IDebugTarget to the launch delegate

`IDebugTargets`
are added to the launch procedure like this:

[source,java]
----
include::res/RegisterDebugTarget.java[]
