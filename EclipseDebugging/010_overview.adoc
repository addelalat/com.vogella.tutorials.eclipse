== Overview

=== What is debugging?
	
(((Breakpoint)))
(((Watchpoint)))
_Debugging_ allows you to run a program interactively while watching the source code and the variables during the execution.

A _breakpoint_ in the source code specifies where the execution of the program should stop during debugging.
Once the program is stopped you can investigate variables, change their content, etc.
		
To stop the execution, if a field is read or modified, you can specify _watchpoints_.

[NOTE]
====
_Breakpoints_ and _watchpoints_ are sometimes called _stop points_.
====

=== Debugging support in Eclipse
		
Eclipse allows you to start a Java program in _Debug mode_.
		
Eclipse provides a _Debug_ _perspective_ which gives you a pre-configured set of _views_. 
Eclipse allows you to control the execution flow via debug commands.
	
=== Setting Breakpoints

To define a breakpoint in your source code, right-click in the left margin in the Java  editor and select _Toggle Breakpoint_. Alternatively you can double-click on this position.

For example in the following screenshot we set a breakpoint on
the
line
`Counter counter = new Counter();`.
