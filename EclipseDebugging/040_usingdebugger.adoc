=== Starting the Debugger

To debug your application, select a Java file with a main method.
Right-click on it and select menu:Debug As[Java Application].

[TIP]
====
If you started an application once via the context menu, you can use the created launch configuration again via the btn:[Debug] button in the Eclipse toolbar.

If you have not defined any breakpoints, program as normally. 
To debug the program you need to define breakpoints.
Eclipse asks you if you want to switch to the _Debug_ _perspective_ once a stop point is reached.
Answer _Yes_ in the corresponding dialog.
Afterwards Eclipse opens this _perspective_.

=== Controlling the program execution

Eclipse provides buttons in the toolbar for controlling the execution of the program you are debugging. 
Typically, it is easier to use the corresponding keys to control this execution.

You can use allow use shortcut key to step through your coding.
The meaning of these keys is explained in the following table.

.Debugging key bindings / shortcuts
[cols="1,3",options="header"]
|===
|Key |Description

|kbd:[F5]
|Executes the currently selected line and goes to the next
line in
your program. If the selected line is a method call the
debugger steps into the
associated
code.
	
|kbd:[F6]
|F6 steps over the call, i.e. it executes a method without stepping into it in the debugger.

|kbd:[F7]
|F7 steps out to the caller of the currently executed method.
This finishes the execution of the current method and returns to the caller of this method.

|kbd:[F8]
|F8 tells the Eclipse debugger to resume the execution of the program code until is reaches the next breakpoint or watchpoint.

The following picture displays the buttons and their related keyboard shortcuts.

The call stack shows the parts of the program which are currently executed and how they relate to each other. 
The current stack is displayed in the _Debug_ view.

=== Breakpoints view and deactivating breakpoints

The _Breakpoints_ view allows you to delete and deactivate _breakpoints_ and _watchpoints_.
You can also modify their properties.

To deactivate a breakpoint, remove the corresponding checkbox in the _Breakpoints_ view.
To delete it you can use the corresponding buttons in the view toolbar. 
These options are depicted in the following screenshot.

If you want to deactivate all your breakpoints you can press the btn:[Skip all breakpoints] button. 
If you press it again, your breakpoints are reactivated.
This button is highlighted in the following screenshot.

=== Evaluating variables in the debugger

The _Variables_ view displays fields and local variables from the current executing stack.
Please note you need to run the debugger to see the variables in this view.

[NOTE]
====
As of Eclipse 4.7 you also see the return statement of the last method call in the debugger.
====

Use the drop-down menu to display static variables.

Via the drop-down menu of the _Variables_ view you can customize the displayed columns.

For example, you can show the actual type of each variable declaration. 
For this select menu:Layout[Select Columns... > Type].

=== Changing variable assignments in the debugger

The _Variables_ view allows you to change the values assigned to your variable at runtime.
This is depicted in the following screenshot.

image::variablesview_change10.png[Changing the value of a variable]

=== Controlling the display of the variables with Detail Formatter

By default the _Variables_ view uses the `toString()` method to determine how to display the variable.

You can define a _Detail Formatter_ in which you can use Java code to define how a variable is displayed.

For example, the `toString()` method in the `Counter` class may show meaningless information, e.g. `com.vogella.combug.first.Counter@587c94`. 
To make this output more readable you can right-click on the corresponding variable and select the menu:New Detail Formater...[] entry from the context menu.

image::variables40.png[New Detail Formater Screenshot]

Afterwards you can use a method of this class to determine the output. 
In this example the `getResult()` method of this class is used. 
This setup is depicted in the following screenshot.
