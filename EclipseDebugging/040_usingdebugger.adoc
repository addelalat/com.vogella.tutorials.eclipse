== Debugging in Eclipse

=== Setting Breakpoints

To set
breakpoints in your source code right-click in the small left
margin in your
source
code editor
and select
_Toggle Breakpoint_. Alternatively you can
double-click
on this position.

For example in the following screenshot we set a breakpoint on
the
line
`Counter counter = new Counter();`.

=== Starting the Debugger

To debug your application, select a Java file
which can be executed,
right-click on it and select
menu:Debug As[Java Application].

After you have started the application once via the context menu, you
can
use the created launch configuration again via the
btn:[Debug] button in the Eclipse toolbar.

If you have not defined any breakpoints, this will run your
program as normal. To debug the program you
need to define
breakpoints.

If you start the debugger, Eclipse asks
you
if you
want
to switch to the
_Debug_
_perspective_
once a stop point is reached.
Answer
_Yes_
in the corresponding dialog.

Afterwards Eclipse opens this
_perspective_, which
looks
similar to the following screenshot.

=== Controlling the program execution

Eclipse provides buttons in the toolbar for controlling the
execution of the program you are debugging. Typically it is easier to
use the corresponding keys to control this execution.

You can use the btn:[F5], btn:[F6], btn:[F7] and btn:[F8] key to step through your coding.
The meaning of these keys is explained in the following table.

.Debugging key bindings / shortcuts
[cols="1,3",options="header"]
|===
|Key |Description

|F5 
|Executes the currently selected line and goes to the next
line in
your program. If the selected line is a method call the
debugger steps into the
associated
code.
	
|F6 
|F6 steps over the call, i.e. it executes a method without stepping into it in the debugger.

|F7
|F7 steps out to the caller of the currently executed method.
This finishes the execution of the current method and returns to the caller of this method.

|F8
|F8 tells the Eclipse debugger to resume the execution of the program code until is reaches the next breakpoint or watchpoint.

The
following picture
displays
the buttons and their related
keyboard
shortcuts.

The call stack shows the parts of the program which are currently executed and how they relate to each other. 
The current stack is displayed in the _Debug_ view.

=== Breakpoints view and deactivating breakpoints

The
_Breakpoints_
view
allows you to delete and deactivate
_stop points_, i.e.
_breakpoints_
and
_watchpoints_
and to modify their properties.

To deactivate a breakpoint, remove the corresponding checkbox in the _Breakpoints_ view.
To delete it you can use the corresponding buttons in the view toolbar. 
These options are depicted in the following screenshot.

If you want to deactivate all your breakpoints you
can
press the
btn:[Skip all breakpoints] button. If you press it again, your breakpoints are
reactivated. This
button is highlighted in the following screenshot.

=== Evaluating variables in the debugger

The
_Variables_
view
displays fields and local variables from
the
current executing stack.
Please note
you need to run the debugger to see the
variables in this
view.

Use the drop-down menu to display static variables.

Via the drop-down menu of the
_Variables_
view
you can customize the displayed columns.

For example,
you can show
the
actual type of each variable
declaration. For this select
menu:Layout[Select Columns... > Type].

=== Changing variable assignments in the debugger

The
_Variables_
view
allows you to change the values assigned to your variable at runtime.
This is
depicted in the following screenshot.

=== Controlling the display of the variables with Detail Formatter

By default the
_Variables_
view
uses the
`toString()`
method to determine how to display the variable.

You can define a
_Detail Formatter_
in which you can use Java code to
define how a variable is displayed.

For example the
`toString()`
method in the
`Counter`
class
may show meaningless information, e.g.
`de.vogella.combug.first.Counter@587c94`. To make this output more readable you can right-click on the
corresponding variable
and select the
menu:New Detail Formater...[]
entry from the context menu.

image::variables40.gif[New Detail Formater Screenshot]

Afterwards you can use a method of this class to determine the
output. In this example the
`getResult()`
method of this class is used. This setup is depicted in the following
screenshot.
