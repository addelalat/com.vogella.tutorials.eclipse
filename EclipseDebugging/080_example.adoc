== Exercise: Create Project for debugging

=== Create Project

To practice debugging create a new Java project called
`de.vogella.combug.first`
. Also create
the package
`de.vogella.combug.first`
and create
the following classes.

[source,java]
----
include::res/first/Counter.java[]
----

[source,java]
----
include::res/first/Main.java[]
----

=== Debugging

Set a breakpoint in the
`Counter`
class. Debug your program and follow the execution of the
`count`
method.

Define a
_Detailed Formatter_
for your
`Counter`
which uses the
`getResult`
method. Debug your program again and verify that your new formatter
is used.

Delete your breakpoint and add a breakpoint for class loading.
Debug your program again and verify that the debugger stops when your
class is loaded.
