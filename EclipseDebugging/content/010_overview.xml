== Overview

=== What is debugging?
		
		
			_Debugging_
			allows you to run a program interactively while watching
			the
			source
			code
			and the variables during the execution.
		
		
			By
			_breakpoints_
			<indexterm>
				<primary>Breakpoint</primary>
			</indexterm>
			in the source code you specify where the execution of the
			program
			should stop. To stop the execution only if a field is read or
			modified, you can specify
			_watchpoints_
			<indexterm>
				<primary>Watchpoint</primary>
			</indexterm>
			.
		
		
			_Breakpoints_
			and
			_watchpoints_
			can be summarized as
			_stop points_
			.
		
		Once the program is stopped you can investigate variables,
			change their content, etc.
		
	

=== Debugging support in Eclipse
		
			Eclipse allows you to start a Java program
			in
			_Debug mode_
			.
		
		
			Eclipse has a special
			_Debug_
			_perspective_
			which gives you a preconfigured set of
			_views_
			. In this
			_perspective_
			you
			control the execution
			process of your program and
			can
			investigate the
			state of
			the variables.
