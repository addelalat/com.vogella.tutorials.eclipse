== Exercise: Create Project for debugging

=== Create Project
		
			To practice debugging create a new Java project called
			`de.vogella.combug.first`
			. Also create
			the package
			`de.vogella.combug.first`
			and create
			the following classes.
		

		
			<programlisting>
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="../examples/first/Counter.java" />
			</programlisting>
		

		
			<programlisting>
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="../examples/first/Main.java" />
			</programlisting>
		

	

=== Debugging
		
			Set a breakpoint in the
			`Counter`
			class. Debug your program and follow the execution of the
			`count`
			method.
		
		
			Define a
			_Detailed Formatter_
			for your
			`Counter`
			which uses the
			`getResult`
			method. Debug your program again and verify that your new formatter
			is used.
		
		Delete your breakpoint and add a breakpoint for class loading.
			Debug your program again and verify that the debugger stops when your
			class is loaded.
