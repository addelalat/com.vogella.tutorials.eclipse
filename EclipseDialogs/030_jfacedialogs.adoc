=== Dialogs from JFace

JFace contains several
frequently used dialogs which are not
based on the
native dialogs as
well as
a framework for
building custom
dialogs.

NOTE: Even though JFace dialogs are not native, they follow the native platform semantics for things like the button order.

=== Using the static helper methods of the JFace MessageDialog class

The
`MessageDialog`
class
provides static methods to open commonly used
dialogs, for
example
an
information
or a warning
dialog. The following
code demonstrates the
usage
of
these static methods.

[source,java]
----

----

=== Using the JFace MessageDialog class directly

The
`MessageDialog`
class also allows the customization of the
buttons in the dialog.
The
following code demonstrates its
usage.

[source,java]
----
include::res/jface/messageDialog.java[]
----

If you open this dialog, it looks similar to the following
screenshot.

Several of these dialogs return the user selection, e.g.
the
`openConfirm()`
method returns
true if the user selected the
btn:[OK]
button.
The following example code prompts the user for confirmation
and handles the result.

=== ErrorDialog

The
`ErrorDialog`
class can be used
to display one or more errors to the user. If an
error
contains
additional detailed information then a
button is
automatically
added, which shows or hides this information when
pressed by the
user.

The following snippet shows a handler class which
uses this
dialog.

[source,java]
----
include::res/jface/ShowErrorDialogHandler.java[]
----

If you trigger this handler, the dialog shows the exception
messages and the detail page contains the stacktrace,
as depicted in
the
following screenshot.

=== Creating a custom dialog

The
`org.eclipse.jface.dialogs.Dialog`
class can be extended to create your own
dialog implementation. This
class creates an
area in which you can place
controls and add
an
_OK_
and
btn:[Cancel] button (or other custom buttons).

Your class needs to implement the
`createDialogArea()`
method. This method gets a
`Composite`
which expects to get a
`GridData`
object assigned as its layout data. Via the
`super.createDialogArea(parent)`
method call, you can create a
`Composite`
to which you can add your controls. This is demonstrated by the
following example code.

[source,java]
----
include::res/jface/MyDialog.java[]
----

TIP: The example code demonstrates how to set the title of your custom
dialog via the
`configureShell()`
method.

If you open this dialog it looks similar to the following
screenshot.

=== TitleAreaDialog

You can also implement your custom
dialog
based on the
`TitleAreaDialog`
class.

`TitleAreaDialog`
has a reserved space for providing feedback to the user. You can set
the text in this space via the
`setMessage()`
and
`setErrorMessage()`
methods.

The following example shows a custom defined
`TitleAreaDialog`.

[source,java]
----
include::res/jface/MyTitleAreaDialog.java[]
----

This dialog is depicted in the following screenshot.

image::jface_customdialog20.png[Custom dialog]

The usage of this dialog is demonstrated in the
following code
snippet. This code might for example be used in a
handler.

[source,java]
----
include::res/jface/OpenMyDialog.java[]
