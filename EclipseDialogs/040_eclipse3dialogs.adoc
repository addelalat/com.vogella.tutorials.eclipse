== Selection Dialogs

Eclipse provides several standard selection
_Dialogs_
in Eclipse 3.x. In Eclipse 3.x you can directly use them, in
Eclipse
4.x you may have to copy them into your plug-in and
modify them
slightly. I still list them here, so that you can use their code as
examples.

A release after Eclipse 4.2 might make the dialogs directly
available again.

Here is a list of these
_Dialogs_
.

* ElementListSelectionDialog
* ListDialog
* ElementTreeSelectionDialog
* CheckTreeSelectionDialog

For example
`ElementListSelectionDialog`
allows you to select elements from a list where the
dialog provides a
filter for the elements.
