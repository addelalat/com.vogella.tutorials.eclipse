== Creating a password dialog

Create a
`com.example.e4.rcp.todo.dialogs`
package in your application plug-in.

Create a new class called
_PasswordDialog_
which extends the
_Dialog_
class. This dialog allows you to enter a user name and a
password.

To use the dialog in your application,
create a new
menu entry
(and a
command with a handler) which
allows you
to
open this
dialog. The
class
associated with the handler should be
called
_EnterCredentialsHandler_.

include::res/preferences/EnterCredentialsHandler.java[]

WARNING: Ensure that your handler links to the `EnterCredentialsHandler` class and not the `PasswordDialog`.
