== Selection Dialogs

	
		Eclipse provides several standard selection
		_Dialogs_
		in Eclipse 3.x. In Eclipse 3.x you can directly use them, in
		Eclipse
		4.x you may have to copy them into your plug-in and
		modify them
		slightly. I still list them here, so that you can use their code as
		examples.
	
	A release after Eclipse 4.2 might make the dialogs directly
		available again.
	

	
		Here is a list of these
		_Dialogs_
		.
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				ElementListSelectionDialog
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				ListDialog
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				ElementTreeSelectionDialog
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				CheckTreeSelectionDialog
			</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
	

	
		For example
		`ElementListSelectionDialog`
		allows you to select elements from a list where the
		dialog provides a
		filter for the elements.
