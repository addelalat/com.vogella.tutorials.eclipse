== Using drag and drop in SWT
SWT supports drag and drop based on transfer types defined based on the `org.eclipse.swt.dnd.Transfer` class.
Every widget element can define that it provides a certain transfer type as source.
It can also define that it accepts a transfer type as destination.

Eclipse provides several pre-defined transfer types. 
To define your custom transfer type it is recommended to subclass the `org.eclipse.swt.dnd.ByteArrayTransfer` class.
