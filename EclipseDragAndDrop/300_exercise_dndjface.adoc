== Exercise: Implement drag and drop

The following exercise demonstrates the usage of drag and drop for customer domain objects and SWT widgets.
You drag and drop between two JFace viewers (a table and a tree).
			
=== Create new project

Create a new Eclipse RCP application called `com.vogella.dnd.jface` with two views.

Create the following model class. 

[source,java]
----
include::res/dndswt/MyDragSourceListener.java[]
----

[source,java]
----
include::res/model/Todo.java[]
----
	

Create the following content providers (Singletons).

[source,java]
----
include::res/model/ContentProvider.java[]
----

[source,java]
----
include::res/model/ContentProviderTree.java[]
----

Create the following label and content provider for your JFace viewers.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/viewers/TableContentProvider.java[]
----	

[source,java]
----
include::res/viewers/TreeContentProvider.java[]
----	

[source,java]
----
include::res/viewers/TableLabelProvider.java[]
----	

[source,java]
----
include::res/viewers/TreeLabelProvider.java[]
----
			
=== Drag and drop Listener

Create the following drag and drop listener. 
These are later assigned to your table and tree widgets.

[source,java]
----
include::res/dnd/MyDragListener.java[]
----	

[source,java]
----
include::res/dnd/MyDropListener.java[]
----	

=== Adjusting your parts

Adjust your views. 
The first view shows a table and allows the user to drag an elements from it. 
The second view accepts drops.

[source,java]
----
include::res/views/TableView.java[]
----

[source,java]
----
include::res/views/TreeView.java[]
----
