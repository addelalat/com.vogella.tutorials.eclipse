== Models and Eclipse EMF

=== Data model
		
			A
			_data model_
			, sometimes also called
			_domain model_
			,
			represents
			the data
			you want to
			work with. For example, if you develop
			an online flight
			booking
			application, you might
			model your
			domain model
			with objects
			like
			`Person`
			,
			`Flight`
			,
			`Booking`
			etc. The EMF tooling allows you to create UML diagrams.
		
		
			A good practice is to model the data model of an application
			independently of
			the
			application logic or user interface.
			This approach
			leads to
			classes
			with almost no
			logic
			and a lot of properties, e.g., a
			`Person`
			class
			could have the
			<property>firstName</property>
			,
			<property>lastName</property>
			,
			<property>Address</property>
			properties, etc.
		

		
			With EMF you define your domain model explicitly. This helps to
			provide clear visibility of the model. The code
			generator for EMF
			models can be adjusted and in its default setting.
			It provides change
			notification
			functionality to the
			model in case of
			model changes.
			EMF
			generates interfaces and a factory to create your objects;
			therefore,
			it
			helps you to
			keep your application clean from the
			individual
			implementation classes.
		
		
			Another advantage is that you can regenerate the Java code from
			the model at any
			point in time.
		
	


=== Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF)
		
			The
			_Eclipse Modeling Framework_
			(EMF) is a set of Eclipse plug-ins which can be used to
			model a data model and
			to generated code or other output based
			on this
			model.
			EMF has a
			distinction
			between the meta-model and
			the
			actual model.
			The
			meta-model
			describes
			the structure of the
			model.
			A
			model is a concrete
			instance of
			this
			meta-model.
		
		
			EMF allows the developer to create the meta-model via different
			means, e.g.,
			XMI,
			Java annotations, UML or an XML
			scheme. It also allows to persists the model data; the default
			implementation
			uses a data format called
			_XML Metadata Interchange_
			.
		
		

		
	


=== Generate data from an EMF model
		
			The information stored in the EMF models can be used to generate
			derived
			output. A typical use case is that you
			use EMF to define the domain model of your application
			and that you
			generate the
			corresponding
			Java
			implementation
			classes
			from
			this model.
			The EMF framework supports that the
			generated code can be safely
			extended by hand.
		
		
			The EMF model (which holds real data based on the
			model structure) can also be used to generate
			different output,
			e.g., HTML pages, or it can be
			interpreted at runtime within an application.
		
	


=== Meta models - Ecore and Genmodel
		
			The EMF meta-model consists
			of
			two parts; the
			_ecore_
			and the
			_genmodel_
			description files.
		
		
			The
			_ecore_
			file contains the
			information about the defined
			classes.
			The
			_genmodel_
			file contains
			additional information for the
			code
			generation, e.g.,
			the
			path
			and file information. The
			_genmodel_
			file
			also contains
			the control
			parameter how the code should be
			generated.
		
	


=== Ecore description file
		
			The
			_ecore_
			file
			allows to define the following elements.
		
		
			<itemizedlist>
				*
					
						`EClass`
						: represents a class, with zero or more attributes and zero or
						more references.
					
				
				*
					
						`EAttribute`
						: represents an attribute which has a name and a
						type.
					
				
				*
					
						`EReference`
						: represents one end of an association between two classes. It has
						flags to indicate if it represents a containment
						and a reference
						class to which it points.
					
				
				*
					
						`EDataType`
						: represents the type of an attribute, e.g.,
						`int`
						,
						`float`
						or
						`java.util.Date`
					
				
			
		
		
			The
			_Ecore_
			model
			shows a root object representing the whole
			model. This model has
			children which represent the
			packages, whose
			children represent the
			classes, while the
			children of the classes
			represent the attributes of
			these
			classes.
		
	

=== Ecore description file
		
			You can create a graphical representation of an existing ecore model via the context menu of an .ecore file and by
			selecting
			menu:Initialize Ecore Diagram...</guimenu>
			</menuchoice>
			.
