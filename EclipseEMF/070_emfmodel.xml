=== Generating Java code
		
			Based on the
			<filename>.genmodel</filename>
			files, you can generate
			Java
			code.
		
		
			Right-click
			on the root node of the
			<filename>.genmodel</filename>
			file
			and select
			_Generate Model Code_
			. This
			creates the
			Java
			implementation of the
			EMF model in
			the
			current
			project.

=== Review the generated code
		
			The generated code will consist of the following:
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<filename>model</filename> -- Interfaces and the Factory to create
						the Java classes
					
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<filename>model.impl</filename> -- Concrete implementation of the
						interfaces
						defined in model
					
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<filename>model.util</filename> -- The AdapterFactory
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
		
		
			The central factory has methods for creating all defined
			objects
			via
			<code>createObjectName()</code>
			methods.
		
		
			For each attribute the generated interface and its
			implementation
			contain
			<code>getter</code>
			and (if allowed in the model
			definition)
			<code>setter</code>
			methods. Each setter also has a generated
			notification to observers of
			the model. This means that other objects
			can attach them to
			the model
			and
			react to changes in the model.
		

		
			Each generated interface extends the
			<code>EObject</code>
			interface.
			<code>EObject</code>
			is the
			base of every EMF class and is the EMF
			equivalent of
			<code>java.lang.Object</code>
			.
			<code>EObject</code>
			and its corresponding
			implementation class
			<code>EObjectImpl</code>
			provide a lightweight base
			class that
			lets the generated
			interfaces and
			classes
			participate in the EMF
			notification and
			persistence
			frameworks.
		

		
			Every generated method is tagged with
			<code>@generated</code>
			. If you
			want to
			manually adjust the method
			and have
			EMF overwrite the
			method during the next generation run,
			you
			need to
			remove this tag.
		

	
[[emfmodel_update">
=== Updating the model
		
			If you change your
			<filename>.ecore</filename>
			model then you can
			update the
			<filename>.genmodel</filename>
			simply by
			reloading.
