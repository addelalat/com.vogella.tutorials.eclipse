== Generating the domain classes

=== Generating Java code
		
			Based on the
			_.genmodel_
			files, you can generate
			Java
			code.
		
		
			Right-click
			on the root node of the
			_.genmodel_
			file
			and select
			_Generate Model Code_
			. This
			creates the
			Java
			implementation of the
			EMF model in
			the
			current
			project.

=== Review the generated code
		
			The generated code will consist of the following:
			<itemizedlist>
				*
					_model_ -- Interfaces and the Factory to create
						the Java classes
					
				
				*
					_model.impl_ -- Concrete implementation of the
						interfaces
						defined in model
					
				
				*
					_model.util_ -- The AdapterFactory
				
			
		
		
			The central factory has methods for creating all defined
			objects
			via
			`createObjectName()`
			methods.
		
		
			For each attribute the generated interface and its
			implementation
			contain
			`getter`
			and (if allowed in the model
			definition)
			`setter`
			methods. Each setter also has a generated
			notification to observers of
			the model. This means that other objects
			can attach them to
			the model
			and
			react to changes in the model.
		

		
			Each generated interface extends the
			`EObject`
			interface.
			`EObject`
			is the
			base of every EMF class and is the EMF
			equivalent of
			`java.lang.Object`
			.
			`EObject`
			and its corresponding
			implementation class
			`EObjectImpl`
			provide a lightweight base
			class that
			lets the generated
			interfaces and
			classes
			participate in the EMF
			notification and
			persistence
			frameworks.
		

		
			Every generated method is tagged with
			`@generated`
			. If you
			want to
			manually adjust the method
			and have
			EMF overwrite the
			method during the next generation run,
			you
			need to
			remove this tag.
		

	

=== Updating the model
		
			If you change your
			_.ecore_
			model then you can
			update the
			_.genmodel_
			simply by
			reloading.
