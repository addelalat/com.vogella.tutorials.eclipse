== Using the model code

=== Overview
		
			The generated model code is standard Java code and can be used
			as such. The following demonstrates how you create
			objects based on
			the
			generated code.
		

	

=== Example
		
			Create a new plug-in project called
			_de.vogella.emf.webpage.usingmodel_
			.
			Add the following dependency to your
			_MANIFEST.MF_
			.
		
		
			<itemizedlist>
				*org.eclipse.emf.ecore
				*com.vogella.emf.webpage.model
			
		
		 Create the following class.

		
			<programlisting>
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/using/UsingEMFModel.java[]
----
		

		
			TIP:
				The
				`*PackageImpl.init()`
				method needs
				to
				be
				called before doing
				anything else as this
				method
				initializes the
				model
				and the listeners.
			</tip>
