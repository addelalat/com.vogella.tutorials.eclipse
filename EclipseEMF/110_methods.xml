== Generating methods
	 By default EMF generates getter and setter for every class. You
		can also add Operations or for example overwrite methods, e.g., the 
		`toString()`
		method. For Article the following toString method was generated
		in "ArticleImpl
	
	
[source,text]
----
include::res/method/toString.txt[]
----
	
	To overwrite this, add a "EOperation" to your model with the name
		toString. Maintain in the properties "EType" EString as return type.

	 Add an annotation with the source
		"http://www.eclipse.org/emf/2002/GenModel" and maintain an entry with
		the key
		"body", the value is the code
		that will
		be generated in to the
		method,
		you find it listed below.

	 You can also generate methods with input parameter, just add
		parameter with their type to your EOperation.
