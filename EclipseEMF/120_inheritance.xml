== Extending an EMF Ecore model (inheritance)

=== Overview
		
			EMF allows to extend existing models via inheritance. The
			following
			will define a base model and an extension based on this base
			model.
			This can for example be used to extend the
			http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseE4/article.html"> Eclipse e4
			application model. It will also demonstrate how to work with EMF
			ecore models
			directly without using the ecore tools.
		

	

=== Example
		
			Create a new EMF project
			"de.vogella.emf.inheritance".
			Create a
			new
			model by selecting File ->
			New -> "Eclipse Modeling
			Framework" ->
			"Ecore
			Model". Name the model
			"base.ecore". Select "EPackage" as the
			basis and maintain the following
			properties for this package.

		 Right-click on the package and select New Child -> EClass.
			Maintain the class "MyBaseClass" with two "EAttributes" of type
			"EString". Create a new "Ecore" model "extendedmodel.ecore". Maintain
			"extended" as the package name. Right-click
			your model and select
			"Load resource".

		 Create a new class "MyExtendedClass" and press "ESuperType".

		 Add your "MyBaseClass".

		 Maintain a new EAtribute "detailedField" on "MyExtendedClass".

		 Create a new genmodel "extended.genmodel" based on
			extended.ecore. Generated Java code and you will see that the
			"MyExtendedClass" has extended "MyBaseClass".
