== Persisting EMF models via XMI
	
The Eclipse Modelling Framework (EMF) allows to store the model
content via the EMF
persistence
framework.
EMF
provides XMI and XML
persistence provider. By default
EMF uses XMI
(XML
Metadata
Interchange).
XMI is
a standard for
exchanging metadata
information via Extensible
Markup
Language (XML).
	
The following demonstrates how you create a EMF model instance,
save it and load it again.
	
If you persistent an EMF object all dependent object will
automatically be persistent.
Objects which do not have a "contains
relationship" must be
added
explicitly to
the
`resource.getContents().add()`. 
If objects are
not
added and not
included in
a contains
relationship an
exception is
thrown when calling the
`resource.save()`
method.
