	<title>Persisting EMF models via XMI</title>
	<para>
		The Eclipse Modelling Framework (EMF) allows to store the model
		content via the EMF
		persistence
		framework.
		EMF
		provides XMI and XML
		persistence provider. By default
		EMF uses XMI
		(XML
		Metadata
		Interchange).
		XMI is
		a standard for
		exchanging metadata
		information via Extensible
		Markup
		Language (XML).

	<para> The following demonstrates how you create a EMF model instance,
		save it and load it again.

	<para>
		If you persistent an EMF object all dependent object will
		automatically be persistent.
		Objects which do not have a "contains
		relationship" must be
		added
		explicitly to
		the
		<code>resource.getContents().add()</code>
		. If
		objects are
		not
		added and not
		included in
		a contains
		relationship an
		exception is
		thrown when calling the
		<code>resource.save()</code>
		method.
