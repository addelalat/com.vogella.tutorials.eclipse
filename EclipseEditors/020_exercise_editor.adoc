== Exercise: Creation of an editor

This tutorials describes the creation of an editor. It also shows how an editor can interact with a view.
We will create a view which shows several tasks.

=== Create project and data model

Create a new empty default http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseRCP/article.html[RCP] project _com.vogella.rcp.editor.example_.
Create the package _com.vogella.rcp.editor.example.model_ and create the following classes in this package.

[source, java]
----
include::res/model/Task.java[]
----

The following class will serve as a data model content provider.

[source, java]
----
include::res/model/TaskService.java[]
----



=== Editor Input

Create the following new class `TaskEditorInput` which implements `IEditorInput`.

[source, java]
----
include::res/editor/TaskEditorInput.java[]
----


=== Adding the editor

Go to _plugin.xml_ and add the extension _org.eclipse.ui.editors_.

Do not use a template.
Use the ID _com.vogella.rcp.editor.example.editor.taskeditor_, any name you want and the class "com.vogella.rcp.editor.example.editor.TaskEditor".

Click on the class hyperlink to create the class.
Make sure the variable _ID_ matches the ID of the editor extension.

[source, java]
----
include::res/editor/TaskEditor.java[]
----


=== Command for opening the editor

Create a http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseCommands/article.html[command] _com.vogella.rcp.editor.example.openEditor_ with the default handler _com.vogella.rcp.editor.example.handler.CallEditor_.

image::open_task_editor_command.png[]

Create the following class "com.vogella.rcp.editor.example.handler.CallEditor".

[source, java]
----
include::res/editor/CallEditor.java[]
----


=== Task overview part

We will create the class `TaskOverview` to use http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseJFaceTable/article.html[JFace Viewers] and add a double-click listener to call the command.
The view makes his viewer available as selection provider via the following line: `getSite().setSelectionProvider(viewer);`.
This make is possible for the command which opens the editor to get the selection of the view.
All workbench parts have a site, which can be accessed via the method getSite().
A site is a http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/DesignPatternFacade/article.html[Facade], which allows access to other parts of the workbench, e.g., the shell, the workbench window, etc.. 
Whenever possible use the site to access Workbench objects.

[source, java]
----
include::res/parts/TaskOverview.java[]
----

Add the _org.eclipse.ui.views_ extension point to the _plugin.xml_ and configure the _com.vogella.rcp.editor.example.taskoverview_ like this:

=== Validating

Run the Eclipse IDE together with your plugin and open the Task Overview part with the Show View menu or the Quick Access (Ctrl + 3).

If you double-click on an item in the view, the editor should opened in the editor area of your Eclipse IDE.

To participate in the global save command, set the isDirty property in your editor and call `firePropertyChange(IEditorPart.PROP_DIRTY);` to notify the workbench.
I leave this as an exercise to the reader.
