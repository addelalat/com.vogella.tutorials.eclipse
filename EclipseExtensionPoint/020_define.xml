== Creating an extension point

	
		A plug-in which declares an extension point must declare the extension
		point in its
		_plugin.xml_
		file. You use the
		_Extension Points_
		tab for the definition.
	

	
		Extension points are described via an XML schema file which is
		referred
		to in the
		_plugin.xml_
		file. This XML schema file defines
		the
		details and the contract of the
		extension point.
		The
		following code demonstrates the link to the
		schema file in the
		_plugin.xml_
		file.

	 The plug-in  typically contains code to
		evaluate
		the
		extensions for
		this extension
		point.
