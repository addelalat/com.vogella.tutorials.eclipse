		(((Extension points and extensions,adding extensions)))
	

	
		The Eclipse IDE provides an
		editor for the
		_plugin.xml_
		file. It is the same editor which is used for modifying the
		_MANIFEST.MF_
		file.
	
	
		Select the
		_Extensions_
		tab in this editor to create new
		extensions.
		On the
		_Extension Points_
		tab you can define new
		extension points.
