== Accessing extensions

The information about the available extension points and the
provided
extensions are stored in a class of type
`IExtensionRegistry`.

NOTE: The Eclipse platform reads the
extension points and provided extensions
once the
plug-in is in the
_RESOLVED_
life cycle status as defined by the OSGi
specification.

In Eclipse applications you can use the dependency injection mechanism
to
get
the
`IExtensionRegistry`
class injected.

In Eclipse 3.x based plug-ins you query for a certain extension via
static methods of the
`Platform`
class. An example is listed in the following code.

TIP: You can access extensions of all extension points via the `IExtensionRegistery`.
