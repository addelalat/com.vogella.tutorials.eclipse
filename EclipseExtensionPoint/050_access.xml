== Accessing extensions

	
		The information about the available extension points and the
		provided
		extensions are stored in a class of type
		`IExtensionRegistry`
		.
	
	NOTE:
		The Eclipse platform reads the
		extension points and provided extensions
		once the
		plug-in is in the
		_RESOLVED_
		life cycle status as defined by the OSGi
		specification.
	</note>

	
		In Eclipse applications you can use the dependency injection mechanism
		to
		get
		the
		`IExtensionRegistry`
		class injected.
	

	
		<programlisting>
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
				parse="text" href="../examples/registry/query2.txt[]
----
	
	
		In Eclipse 3.x based plug-ins you query for a certain extension via
		static methods of the
		`Platform`
		class. An example is listed in the following code.
	
	
		<programlisting>
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
				parse="text" href="../examples/registry/query.txt[]
----
	
	TIP:
		
			You can access extensions of all extension points via the
			`IExtensionRegistery`
			.
		
	</tip>
