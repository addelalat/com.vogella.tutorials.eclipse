== Exercise: Create and evaluate an extension point

=== Target for this exercise

In this exercise you create two new plug-ins. The first one
contains an extension point and the second
contributes an
extension
to
this new extension point. This exercise is to demo the creation and
usage of extension
points. The result
is not intended to
be a realistic
feature.

=== Creating a plug-in for the extension point definition

Create a new plug-in project called
_com.vogella.extensionpoint.definition_
based on the settings of the following screenshot.

=== Create an extension point

Open the
_MANIFEST.MF_
file
or the
_plugin.xml_
file and select the
_Extension Points_
tab.

image::extensionpoint10.png[]

Press the btn:[Add...] button.

Enter
"com.vogella.extensionpoint.definition.greeter" as
_Extension Point ID_
and
"Greeter" as
_Extension Point Name_
in the dialog. The
_Extension Point Schema_
field is automatically
populated based on your input.

Press the
btn:[Finish] button.
The definition of the extension is generated and the
schema
editor
opens. Switch to the
_Definition_
tab.

Add attributes
to the extension point. For that click
on
the
btn:[New Element]
button. Give the new element the name "client".

Select the "client" element and press
_New Attribute_. Give the
new
element the name "class" and the type "java". Enter
`com.vogella.extensionpoint.definition.IGreeter`
as interface name

This interface doesn't exit yet. Press on the
hyperlink called
_Implements_
to
create it based on the
following code.

[source,java]
----
include::res/simple/IGreeter.java[]
----

Go back to your extension point definition and add a choice to
the
extension point. For this select the
_extension_
entry, right-click on it and select
menu:New[Choice].
This defines how often the extension "client" can
be provided by
contributing plug-ins. We will set no restrictions
(unbound).

=== Export the package

Select the
_MANIFEST.MF_
file switch to the
_Runtime_
tab and
export
the
package which contains the
`IGreeter`
interface.

=== Add dependencies

Add the following dependencies via the
_MANIFEST.MF_
file of your new plug-in:

* `org.eclipse.core.runtime`
* `org.eclipse.e4.core.di`

=== Evaluating the registered extensions

The defining plug-in also evaluates the existing extension
points. In the following example you create a handler
class which can
evaluate the existing extensions.

Create the following class.

[source,java]
----
include::res/simple/EvaluateContributionsHandler.java[]
----

The code above uses
the
`ISafeRunnable`
interface. This interface protects the plug-in which defines
the
extension point from malfunction extensions. If an
extension throws an
`Exception`, it will be caught by
`ISafeRunnable`
and
the remaining extensions will still get executed.

Review the
_.exsd_
schema file and
the
reference to this file in the
_plugin.xml_
file.

=== Create a menu entry and add it to your product

Add a dependency to the
`com.vogella.extensionpoint.definition`
plug-in
in the
_MANIFEST.MF_
file of your application plug-in.

Afterwards create a new menu entry called
_Evaluate extensions_
and define a command and handler for this menu entry. In the handler
point to the
`EvaluateContributionsHandler`
class.

Also update your product (via your features) so that the new
plug-in is part of your application.

NOTE: A better approach would be to add the menu entry via a model
fragment or a model processor, but I leave that as
an additional
exercise to the reader.

=== Providing an extension

Create a new simple plug-in called
_com.vogella.extensionpoint.contribution_.

Open the
_MANIFEST.MF_
editor of this new plug-in and select the
_Dependencies_
tab.

Add the
`com.vogella.extensionpoint.definition`
and
`org.eclipse.core.runtime`
plug-ins
as dependencies. Make sure
your plug-in has
the
_This plug-in is a singleton_
flag
set on the
_Overview_
tab for your
_MANIFEST.MF_
file.

Switch to the
_Extensions_
tab and select
btn:[Add...]. Select your custom
extension point
and press the
btn:[Finish] button.

Add a client to your extension point via right-click.

image::extensionpoint140.png[]

Create the
`GreeterGerman`
class
with the
following code.

[source,java]
----
include::res/simple/GreeterGerman.java[]
----

=== Add the plug-in to your product

Add the
`com.vogella.extensionpoint.contribution`
plug-in
to your product (via your features).

=== Validating
Start your application via the product configuration file to
update the plug-ins included in the run
configuration.

In your running application
select
your new menu entry.
The handler
class write the output of your extensions to the
_Console_
view
of your Eclipse IDE.
