	<title>Extensions and extension points


	
		Eclipse provides the concept of
		_extensions_
		to contribute functionality to a certain type of API
		by
		one or more
		plug-ins. The type of API is defined by another plug-in as
		_extension point_
		.
	

	
		These
		extensions and extension points are defined via
		the
		<filename>plugin.xml</filename>
		file.
	

	 This approach is depicted in the following graphic and the
		terminology is described in the following table.

						<entry>
							The plug-in defines a contract (API) with the definition of
							an extension point.
							This allows other plug-ins to add contributions (extensions) to the extension point.
							The
							plug-in which
							defines the
							extension
							point is
							also
							responsible
							for
							evaluating the
							extensions.
							Therefore,
							it typically
							contains the necessary
							code
							to do
							that.

						<entry>
							This plug-in provides an extension (contribution) based on

							Contributions
							can
							be code or data.
