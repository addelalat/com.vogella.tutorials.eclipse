	<para>
		If you create your class directly via the
		<code>IConfigurationElement</code>
		class of the extension you are limited to classes which have a
		default constructor.
		To avoid this
		restriction you can use
		extension factories.
	</para>
	<para>
		To use a factory implement the interface
		<code>IExecutableExtensionFactory</code>
		in the class attribute of your
		extension point definition. The factory
		receives the configuration
		elements and can
		construct the required
		object.
