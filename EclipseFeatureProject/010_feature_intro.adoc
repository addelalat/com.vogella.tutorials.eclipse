== What are feature projects and features?
	
Using the Eclipse wizards you can create feature projects, similarly on how you create plug-in projects.
An
Eclipse
feature project contains
_features_.
	
A
feature
describes a list of plug-ins and other features which can
be
seen
as a logical
unit, i.e., a set of related
components. It also has a
name,
a version number and
in most cases a license information assigned to it.
	
A
feature
is described via a
_feature.xml_
file. The following listing shows an example of such a file.
