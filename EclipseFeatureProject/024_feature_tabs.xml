== The purpose of the tabs in the feature editor
	
		If you open the
		_feature.xml_
		file you can change the feature
		properties via a special editor.
	
	
		The
		_Information_
		tab allows you to enter a description and copyright related
		information for this feature.
	
	
		The
		_Included Plug-ins_
		tab
		allows you to change the included plug-ins
		in
		the feature. If you want to add a plug-in to a feature, use this
		tab. A
		frequent error of new Eclipse developers is to add it to the
		_Dependencies_
		tab.
	
	
		The
		_Included Features_
		tab allows you to include other features into this feature. Via the
		_Dependencies_
		tab you can define other features which must be present to use this
		feature.
	
	
		The
		_Build_
		tab is used for the build process and should include the
		_feature.xml_
		file. The last two tabs give access to the configuration files in text
		format.
