== Advantages of using features
	The grouping of plug-ins into logical units makes it easier to
		handle a set of plug-ins. Instead of adding many
		individual plug-ins
		to
		your product configuration file, you can group
		them using features. That
		increases the visibility
		of your application
		structure.
	

	
		Features can be consumed by the Eclipse update
		manager,
		the
		build
		process
		and optionally for the definition of Eclipse
		products.
		Features
		can
		also be
		used as basis to define a launch
		configuration.
	
	
		Eclipse provides several predefined features, e.g.
		the
		`org.eclipse.e4.rcp`
		for Eclipse RCP applications.
