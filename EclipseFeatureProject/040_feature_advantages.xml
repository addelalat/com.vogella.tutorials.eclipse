	<title>Advantages of using features</title>
	<para>The grouping of plug-ins into logical units makes it easier to
		handle a set of plug-ins. Instead of adding many
		individual plug-ins
		to
		your product configuration file, you can group
		them using features. That
		increases the visibility
		of your application
		structure.
	</para>

	<para>
		Features can be consumed by the Eclipse update
		manager,
		the
		build
		process
		and optionally for the definition of Eclipse
		products.
		Features
		can
		also be
		used as basis to define a launch
		configuration.

	<para>
		Eclipse provides several predefined features, e.g.
		the
		<code>org.eclipse.e4.rcp</code>
		for Eclipse RCP applications.
