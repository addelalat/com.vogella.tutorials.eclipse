== What are fragments in OSGi?
	
A _fragment_ is an optional attachment to another plug-in. 
This other plug-in is called the _host plug-in_. 
At runtime the fragment is merged with its host plug-in and for the runtime both projects are just one. 
Fragments are always optional for their host plug-in and the host plug-in doesn't even know that it exists.
	
The Eclipse IDE supports the creation of fragments via
_fragment projects_.
To create a fragment project select
menu:File[New > Other... > Plug-in Development > Fragment Project].
