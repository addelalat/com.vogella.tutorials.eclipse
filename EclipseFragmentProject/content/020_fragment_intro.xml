	<para>
		A
		<wordasword>fragment</wordasword>
		is an optional attachment to another plug-in. This other plug-in is
		called the
		<wordasword>host plug-in</wordasword>
		. At runtime the
		fragment
		is
		merged with its host
		plug-in and for the
		runtime both
		projects are
		just
		one. Fragments are
		always
		optional for
		their host
		plug-in and the host plug-in doesn't even know that it exists.
