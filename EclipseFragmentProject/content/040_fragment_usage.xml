	<title>Typical use cases for fragments</title>
	<para>
		Fragments can be used to contain test classes. This
		way
		the
		tests
		can access
		the host plug-in classes, even if the
		host
		plug-in
		does
		not
		define them
		as external API. Sometimes tests are also
		contained
		in
		normal plug-ins,
		in this case they can
		only test the
		external
		API of
		other plug-ins.

		Fragments can also be used to contribute property files for
		additional
		translations. This allows contributing
		support for a
		new
		language without the need to adjust
		any other part
		of
		the code.
	</para>

		In
		addition, fragments can also supply native code which is
		specific
		to a
		certain
		system environment.

		A platform filter can be used to define a fragment as valid for a certain platform.
		The Eclipse user interface
		library
		SWT
		uses this
		approach.
		More information on the platform filter can be
		found in the
		Eclipse help
		system if you search for
		the following term: "OSGi Bundle Manifest Headers".
	</para>
	<para>Last but not the least, fragments can be used to contain resources
		like icon sets or other images. This allows you
		to
		customize your
		application icons via the provided fragment.
