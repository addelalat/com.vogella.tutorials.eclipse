== Git support for Eclipse

(((EGit, see=Eclipse Git)))
(((Git support in Eclipse,see=Eclipse Git)))
The Eclipse IDE has excellent support for the Git version control system.
This support is provided by the _EGit_ project via a set of plug-ins (software component).
	
Eclipse uses the _JGit_ library to perform the Git commands.
JGit is a library which implements the Git functionality in Java.
	
The Eclipse Git user guide is bundled with the Eclipse Git installation.
You can invoke it via menu:Help[Help Contents >  EGit Documentation].

.The Eclipse workspace and Git repositories
[TIP]
====
(((Eclipse Git,Workspaces and Git repositories)))
It is good practice to place your Git repositories outside the Eclipse workspace. 
This separates your Git repository from any additional meta-data which Eclipse might create. 
By default, Eclipse Git uses the _git_ folder in the users home directory to clone new repositories. 
This default location can of course be adjusted, see <<egitconfiguration_defaultlocation>> for more information on this.
