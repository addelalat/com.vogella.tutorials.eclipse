		The Eclipse IDE has excellent support for the Git version control system.
		This support is provided via a set of
		plug-ins (software component) from the
		_EGit_
		project.
	
	
		The
		_EGit_
		functionality
		is based on the
		_JGit_
		library.
		_JGit_
		is
		a
		library which implements the
		_Git_
		functionality in
		Java.
