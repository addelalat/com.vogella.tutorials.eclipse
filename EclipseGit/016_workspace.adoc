== The Eclipse workspace and Git repositories
(((Eclipse Git,Workspaces and Git repositories)))
	
It is good
practice to
place your Git
repositories
outside
the
Eclipse
workspace. This separates
your Git repository from any
additional
meta-data which
Eclipse
might
create. By default, Eclipse Git uses the
_git_
folder in the users home directory to clone new repositories. This default location can of course be adjusted, see
<<egitconfiguration_defaultlocation>>
for more information on this.
