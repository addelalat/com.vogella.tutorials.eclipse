		It is good
		practice to
		place your Git
		repositories
		outside
		the
		Eclipse
		workspace. This separates
		your Git repository from any
		additional
		meta-data which
		Eclipse
		might
		create. By default, Eclipse Git uses the
		<filename>git</filename>
		folder in the users home directory to clone new repositories. This default location can of course be adjusted, see
		<xref linkend="egitconfiguration_defaultlocation" />
		for more information on this.
