== Installation of Git support into Eclipse
	
Most Eclipse IDE
downloads
from Eclipse.org contain
support for Git
in their
default
configuration. In
this case no additional installation
is
required.
	
If the Git functionality is missing in your
Eclipse IDE installation,
you
can install it
via
the Eclipse installation
manager. 
Start this manager
via the
menu:Help[Install new Software...]
menu entry by using the following update site URL:
	
[source,bourne]

include::res/links/p2.txt[]

The dialog to install the Eclipse Git team provider is depicted
in the following
screenshot.
