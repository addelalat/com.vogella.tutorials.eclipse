== Using the Git Staging view

(((Eclipse Git,Staging view)))
Eclipse gives you several options to stage and commit your changes.
The _Git Staging_ view provides a convenient compact overview on all changes you have done compared to the current HEAD revision.
	
This view presents which files you have touched and which files will be included in the next commit.
`Unstaged Changes` lists those changes which you have done locally but which you have not yet added to the staging area.
`Staged Changes` list those changes which you already have added to the staging area. 
You can drag and drop files from one area to the other.
To commit the staged changes you write your commit message and press the btn:[Commit] button which is highlighted in the following screenshot.

You can switch between different repositories or even restart Eclipse without losing a commit message and it allows incremental staging for changes.
	
You can open the _Git Staging_ view via the menu:Window[Show View > Other... > Git > Git Staging]
menu.
