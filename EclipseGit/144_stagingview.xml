== Using the Git Staging view
	
		(((Eclipse Git,Staging view)))
	


	
		Eclipse gives you several options to stage and commit your changes.
		The
		_Git Staging_
		view
		provides a convenient compact overview on all changes you have
		done compared to the current HEAD revision.
	
	
		The
		_Git Staging_
		view
		is
		non-modal. You can switch between
		different repositories or even
		restart Eclipse without
		losing a commit
		message and it allows
		incremental
		staging for changes.
	
	
		Open the
		_Git Staging_
		view
		via the
		menu:
			<guimenu>Window[Show View > Other... > Git > Git Staging]
		menu.
	
	
		In this
		view
		you
		select all files which have changed and drag them into
		the
		_Staged Changes_
		area. To commit the staged changes you
		write a descriptive commit
		message and press the
		_Commit_
		button which is highlighted in the following screenshot.

	Perform these actions for your initial changes. Afterwards the
		first version of
		your Java project is
		under
		version
		control. If you don't
		experience any
		hardware error your
		data
		is now
		safely stored in your
		local
		Git
		repository and you can
		always
		restore
		your
		Eclipse project to
		this
		initial point.
