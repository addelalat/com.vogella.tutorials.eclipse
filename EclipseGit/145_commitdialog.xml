== Using the Git commit dialog

	
		You can also commit changes with the Git commit dialog. For this
		right-click on a resource and select
		menu:Team[Commit]
		from the context menu.
	
	The dialog allows you to add changed and new files to the
		staging area and
		commit the changes.

	NOTE:
		The commit dialog does not allow committing the removal of a
			file, since the commit dialog ignores the Git index.
