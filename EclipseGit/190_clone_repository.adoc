== Clone an existing repository
(((Eclipse Git,clone repository)))

Eclipse
allows you to clone an existing Git repository and to
import existing
projects from this repository into your Eclipse
workspace by using a wizard.

Select menu:File[Import > Git > Project from Git].

Select _URI_ in the next dialog.

Enter the URL to your Git repository. Git supports
several protocols,
e.g.
_git://_
,
_ssh://_
and
_https://_
.
You only have to paste the URL to the first line of the dialog, the
rest will be filled out automatically.

NOTE: Some proxy servers block the
_git://_
and
_ssh://_
protocols. If you face issues, please try to use the
_https://_
or
_http://_
protocol.

For example the following URI
can be used to clone the example
projects of the Eclipse 4 application development book:
git://github.com/vogella/eclipse4book.git

The above links uses the git protocol, alternatively you can also
use the http protocol: http://github.com/vogella/eclipse4book.git

After pressing the
btn:[Next]
button the system will allow you to import the
existing
branches. You
should select at least
_master_
as this is typically the main development branch.

The next dialog allows you to specify where the repository
should
be
copied to and which local branch should be created initially.

After the Git repository is cloned,
_EGit_
opens an additional
import dialog which allows importing the Eclipse
projects from the
Git
repository.

Once this dialog is completed, you have checked out (cloned) the
projects
into a local Git repository
and you can use Git
operation on
these
projects.
