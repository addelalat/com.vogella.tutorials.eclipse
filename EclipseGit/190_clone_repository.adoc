Enter the URL to your Git repository.
Git supports several protocols, e.g. _git://_, _ssh://_ and _https://_.
You can paste the clone URL to the first line of the dialog, the rest of the dialog is  filled based on this data.

[NOTE] 
====
Some proxy servers block the _git://_ and _ssh://_ protocols. 
If you face issues, please try to use the _https://_ or _http://_ protocol.
====

For example the following URI can be used to clone the example projects of the Eclipse 4 application development book:

git://github.com/vogella/eclipse4book.git

The above link uses the git protocol, alternatively you can also use the http protocol: http://github.com/vogella/eclipse4book.git

as this is typically the main development branch.
