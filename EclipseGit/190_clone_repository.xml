		import existing
		projects from this repository into your Eclipse
		workspace by using a wizard.

			<textobject>
				<phrase>URI selected in EGit</phrase>
			</textobject>
		
	




	
		Enter the URL to your Git repository. Git supports
		several protocols,
		e.g.
		_git://_
		,
		_ssh://_
		and
		_https://_
		.
		You only have to paste the URL to the first line of the dialog, the
		rest will be filled out automatically.
	
	NOTE:
		
			Some proxy servers block the
			_git://_
			and
			_ssh://_
			protocols. If you face issues, please try to use the
			_https://_
			or
			_http://_
			protocol.
		
	</note>
	
		For example the following URI
		can be used to clone the example
		projects of the Eclipse 4 application development book:
		git://github.com/vogella/eclipse4book.git
	
	The above links uses the git protocol, alternatively you can also
		use the http protocol: http://github.com/vogella/eclipse4book.git

		After pressing the
		_Next_
		button the system will allow you to import the
		existing
		branches. You
		should select at least
		_master_
		as this is typically the main development branch.

	 The next dialog allows you to specify where the repository
		should
		be
		copied to and which local branch should be created initially.

		After the Git repository is cloned,
		_EGit_
		opens an additional
		import dialog which allows importing the Eclipse
		projects from the
		Git
		repository.

	 Once this dialog is completed, you have checked out (cloned) the
		projects
		into a local Git repository
		and you can use Git
		operation on
		these
		projects.
