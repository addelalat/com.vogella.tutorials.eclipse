== Starting a merge operation in Eclipse

=== Merge
		
Eclipse supports merging of branches to add the changes
committed on
one branch into another branch.
		
Checkout the branch into which you
want to merge the
changes into and
select your project
and
menu:Team[Merge]
to start the merge dialog.

=== Solving merge conflicts
		
If during a Git operation, two changes are conflicting, you
have to
solve these conflicts manually.
Eclipse Git
highlights the affected
files in the
_Package Explorer_
or
_Project Explorer_
view.
		
Eclipse Git supports the resolution
of these merge
conflicts. To
trigger this via the explorer views, right-click on a
file with merge
conflicts and select
menu:Team[Merge Tool].
		
You can also use the
_Git staging_
view
to find the conflicting files. In large
projects this is usually
faster
than navigating the
_Package Explorer_
or
_Project Explorer_
view.
		
This opens a dialog, asking you which merge mode you would like to
use.
The easiest way to see the conflicting changes
is
to use the
_Use HEAD (the last local version) of conflicting files_
as merge mode. This way you see the original changes on the left
side
and the conflicting and non-conflicting changes
on the right side.

You can manually edit the text on
the left side or use the
btn:[Copy current change from right to left] button to copy the changes from right to left.

Eclipse also allows to show the common ancestor of both commits to make the merge easier. Press the
btn:[Hide/Show Ancestor Pane]
button for that. This is demonstrated by the
following screenshots.

Once you have manually merged the changes, select
menu:Team[Add]
from the context menu of the resource to mark the conflicts as
resolved and
commit the merge commit via
menu:Team[Commit].
