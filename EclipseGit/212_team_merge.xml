			Eclipse supports merging of branches to add the changes
			committed on
			one branch into another branch.
		
		
			Checkout the branch into which you
			want to merge the
			changes into and
			select your project
			and
			menu:Team[Merge]
			to start the merge dialog.

=== Solving merge conflicts
		<indexterm>

			</secondary>
		</indexterm>
		
			If during a Git operation, two changes are conflicting, you
			have to
			solve these conflicts manually.
			Eclipse Git
			highlights the affected
			files in the
			_Package Explorer_
			or
			_Project Explorer_
			view.
		
		
			Eclipse Git supports the resolution
			of these merge
			conflicts. To
			trigger this via the explorer views, right-click on a
			file with merge
			conflicts and select
			menu:Team[Merge Tool]
			.
		
		
			You can also use the
			_Git staging_
			view
			to find the conflicting files. In large
			projects this is usually
			faster
			than navigating the
			_Package Explorer_
			or
			_Project Explorer_
			view.
		
		
			This opens a dialog, asking you which merge mode you would like to
			use.
			The easiest way to see the conflicting changes
			is
			to use the
			_Use HEAD (the last local version) of conflicting files
			_
			as merge mode. This way you see the original changes on the left
			side
			and the conflicting and non-conflicting changes
			on the right side.

			You can manually edit the text on
			the left side or use the
			_Copy current change from right to left_
			button to copy the changes from right to left.

			Eclipse also allows to show the common ancestor of both commits to make the merge easier. Press the
			_Hide/Show Ancestor Pane_
			button for that. This is demonstrated by the
			following screenshots.

			Once you have manually merged the changes, select
			menu:Team[Add]
			from the context menu of the resource to mark the conflicts as
			resolved and
			commit the merge commit via
			menu:Team[Commit]
			.
