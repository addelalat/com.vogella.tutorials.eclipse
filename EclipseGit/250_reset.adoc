=== git reset

The

on a
certain commit and select
menu:Reset[]
and the reset mode you would like to use.

=== Finding "invisible" commits with the Reflog view
		
Commits are not visible in the Git history if they can't be
reached from a
branch or
tag. This might happen during a reset, commit
amend or rebase
operation. By default, such invisible commits are
removed after two weeks by the Git system.
		
The
_Git Reflog_
view
keeps track of the movements of the HEAD pointer and the
movements of each branch. This
view
allows
you to find a commit again,
e.g., if you used the
`git reset --hard`
command to remove certain commits.
