		<title>Finding "invisible" commits with the Reflog view</title>
		<para>Commits are not visible in the Git history if they can't be
			reached from a
			branch or
			tag. This might happen during a reset, commit
			amend or rebase
			operation. By default, such invisible commits are
			removed after two weeks by the Git system.
		</para>
		<para>
			The
			<guilabel>Git Reflog</guilabel>
			view
			keeps track of the movements of the HEAD pointer and the
			movements of each branch. This
			view
			allows
			you to find a commit again,
			e.g., if you used the
			<code>git reset --hard</code>
			command to remove certain commits.
