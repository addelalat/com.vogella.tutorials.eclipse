== Using git cherry-pick

In the _History_ view, you can cherry-pick a commit via the context menu.

A combination of git reset and git cherry-pick allows you to move the changes done in a commit to anther branch.
Assume you have a bad commit which you would like to remove from the history of branch followed by a good commit.
This situation is depicted in the following screenshot.

For this you would make a hard reset on the commit of origin/master.

Afterwards you can cherry-pick the good commit.

This results in a history without the bad commit.
