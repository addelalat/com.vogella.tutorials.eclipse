== Using git cherry-pick
	
		In the
		_History_
		view, you can cherry-pick a commit via the context menu.
	
	A combination of git reset and git cherry-pick allows you to
		move
		the changes done in a commit to anther branch. Assume you have a
		bad
		commit which you would like to
		remove from the history of branch
		followed by a good commit. This
		situation is depicted in the following
		screenshot.

	For this you would make a hard reset on the commit of
		origin/master.

	Afterwards you can cherry-pick the good commit.

			<textobject>
				<phrase>Situation before the cherry pick</phrase>
			</textobject>
		
	
	This results in a history without the bad commit. 
	NOTE:
		
			You can do the same with interactive rebase.
