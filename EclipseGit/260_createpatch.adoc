== Creating patches
(((Eclipse Git,patch)))
	
To create a patch for a set of changes with Eclipse Git, select the
resources
for which you want to create a patch in the
_Package Explorer_
view,
right
click and select
menu:Team[Create Patch].
	
image::egit_createpatch10.png[Create Patch via EGit menu path]
	
image::egit_createpatch20.png[Create Patch via Eclipse Git]
	
The resulting file can be used to get applied to another Git
repository, via
menu:Team[Apply Patch]
. You can also apply the patch on a system where Git isn't installed
at all, i.e., you don't need a Git repository to apply a patch.
