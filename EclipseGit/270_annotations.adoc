== Blame annotations
(((Eclipse Git,blame)))

The Git tooling in Eclipse allows displaying annotations to see which
line
was last changed by
whom
and which commit. To enable this,
right-click on your file and
select
menu:Team[Show Annotations].

Afterwards you can place the mouse on the left side of the editor
and a popup dialog
shows the commit information and the change applied
by the shown commit.

TIP: To ignore whitespace changes in the Git blame annotations in Eclipse, select
menu:Window[Preferences > Team > Git]
and select
_Ignore whitespace changes_.
