== Adjusting the history with interactive rebase

=== Support for interactive rebase in Eclipse
(((Eclipse Git,Interactive rebase)))
Git allows to adjust the existing commit history the interactive rebase functionality. Eclipse supports this
functionality
rebase via the
_History_
view and the
_Git Interactive Rebase_
view.

=== Actions available via the History view
(((Eclipse Git,Interactive rebase via the History view)))
To reword a commit, right-click on it in the
_History_
view and select
menu:Modify[Reword]
to change the commit message.

You can squash several commits by selecting them in the
_History_
view and by using the
menu:Modify[Squash]
menu entry from the context menu.

The above options are simplified ways to do an interactive
rebase.

=== Using the Git Interactive Rebase view
(((Eclipse Git,Interactive rebase via the Git Interactive Rebase view)))
The
_Git Interactive Rebase_
view allow you to change the order of commits, combine or remove commits, adjust commits and change the commit
message.

To start the full interactive rebase open the
_History_
view and click
menu:Rebase Interactive[]
on the context menu of the commit
preceding the
oldest
commit you want
to
rewrite. Often this
is the one
origin/master
points
to.

This opens the
_Git Interactive Rebase_
view. It shows the rebase plan populated with the commits to be
modified
in topological order in the sequence they will
be processed. This order is the reverse order which you see via the
`git log`
command or in the
_History_
view.
The initial action for all commits is "Pick".

The Eclipse Git tooling supports the following actions.

.Interactive rebase actions
|===
|Action |Description

|pick
|includes the selected commit, moving pick entries enables reordering of commits

|skip
|removes a commit

|edit
|amends the commit

|squash
|combines the changes of the commit with the previous commit and combines their commit messages

|fixup
|squashes the changes of a commit into the previous commit discarding the squashed commit's message

|reword
|similar to pick but allows modifying the commit message

|===

Use this view to finalize the rebase plan. For example you
can
reorder commits with the arrow buttons and select
the rebase
action you
want to apply to the commit. The following screenshot
demonstrates a
possible selection.

When the rebase plan is finalized, click the
btn:[Start]
button to start the interactive rebase command.
Eclipse Git processes
the
plan. It stops at all commits with an action
which
needs
user
feedback, for example the reword action which requires entering
the new
commit message. The dialog for
changing the commit message is depicted
in the following screenshot.

Here is the result of the rebase operation displayed in the
_History_
view.

TIP: If something goes wrong during the rebase operation you can
select
_Abort_
in order to stop the rebase operation and
roll back to the
starting
point.
