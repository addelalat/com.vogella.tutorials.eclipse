=== Using the Git Interactive Rebase view
		<indexterm>
			<primary>Eclipse Git
			</primary>
			<secondary>Interactive rebase via the Git Interactive Rebase view
			</secondary>
		</indexterm>
		
			The
			_Git Interactive Rebase_
			view allow you to change the order of commits, combine or remove commits, adjust commits and change the commit
			message.
		
		
			To start the full interactive rebase open the
			_History_
			view and click
			menu:Rebase Interactive</guimenu>
			</menuchoice>
			on the context menu of the commit
			preceding the
			oldest
			commit you want
			to
			rewrite. Often this
			is the one
			origin/master
			points
			to.

			This opens the
			_Git Interactive Rebase_
			view. It shows the rebase plan populated with the commits to be
			modified
			in topological order in the sequence they will
			be processed. This order is the reverse order which you see via the
			`git log`
			command or in the
			_History_
			view.
			The initial action for all commits is "Pick".

			Use this view to finalize the rebase plan. For example you
			can
			reorder commits with the arrow buttons and select
			the rebase
			action you
			want to apply to the commit. The following screenshot
			demonstrates a
			possible selection.

			When the rebase plan is finalized, click the
			_Start_
			button to start the interactive rebase command.
			Eclipse Git processes
			the
			plan. It stops at all commits with an action
			which
			needs
			user
			feedback, for example the reword action which requires entering
			the new
			commit message. The dialog for
			changing the commit message is depicted
			in the following screenshot.

			Here is the result of the rebase operation displayed in the
			_History_
			view.

		TIP:
			
				If something goes wrong during the rebase operation you can
				select
				_Abort_
				in order to stop the rebase operation and
				roll back to the
				starting
				point.
