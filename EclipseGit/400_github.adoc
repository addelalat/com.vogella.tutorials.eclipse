== Using Eclipse Git with GitHub

=== Clone project
		
Copy the URL from GitHub and select in Eclipse from the menu the
menu:File[Import > Git > Projects from Git]
		
Eclipse fills out most of the fields based on the URL in the
clipboard. Enter your user and password to be able to push to GitHub.
Alternative you can also use an SSH key. You can configure Eclipse to
know your SSH via the
menu:Window[Preferences > General > Network Connection > SSH2]
preference setting. This setting is depicted in the following
screenshot.

=== Push changes
		
After you made changes and committed them to your local repository,
you can select
menu:Team[Push to upstream]
on the project folder, to push your changes to your GitHub. This
requires write access to the GitHub repository.
