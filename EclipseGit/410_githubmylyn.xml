=== The Eclipse Mylyn plug-in
		
			Eclipse Mylyn provides task integration for GitHub issues,
			GitHub
			pull
			and Gist (short text snippets) into the Eclipse IDE.
		
		
			There is a GitHub connector
			for
			Mylyn available, please see
			http://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/GitHub/UserGuide"> GitHub Mylyn User Guide
			for details.
		

		
			You install it via
			menu:Help[Install new Software]
			and the update site of your release.

=== Manage pull requests in Eclipse
		
			You can integrate your pull requests at GitHub into Eclipse by
			creating a new query from the
			_Task List_
			view. This is demonstrated via the following screenshots.

		NOTE:
			Unfortunately the GitHub connect does currently not support
				that you merge the pull request.
