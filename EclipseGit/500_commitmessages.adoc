== Writing good commit messages

=== Importance of Git commit messages

A _commit_ adds a new version to the repository. 
This version is described by a _commit message_.

The _commit message_describes the changes recorded in a commit.
It should help the user to understand the history of the repository.

A commit message should therefore be descriptive and informative without repeating the code changes.
	
=== Guidelines for useful commit messages

A commit message should have a header and a body. 
The header should be less than 50 with a maximum of 72 characters.
The body should wrap its text at 72.
The body is separated from the header by an empty line.

This ensures that the commit message is displayed well on the command line or in graphical tools. 

The body describes the reason why the change was made. 
The changes in the file can be reviewed with the help of Git.

The commit message should be in present tense, e.g., "Adds better error handling" instead of "Added better error handling".

The last paragraph can also contain _metadata_ as key-value pairs.
This data is also referred to as the _commit message footer_.

This metadata can be used to trigger a certain behavior. 
For example, the _Gerrit_ code review system uses the _Change-Id_ key followed by a _change-id_.
This _changed id_ is used to identify to which review the message belongs.

The _commit message footer_ can also have e.g., 'Signed-off-by'.
Or it may link to a bug tracking system, e.g., 'Bug: 1234'.

=== Example message

The following can serve as an example for a commit message.

[source,text]
----
include::res/message/message.txt[]
----

=== Good and bad example for a Git history

The following listing shows the output of the `git log --oneline` command of a Git repository with bad commit messages. 
The first value in each line is the shortened SHA-1, the second the commit message.
This history is not useful.

[source,text]
----
include::res/message/bad.txt[]
----

The next listing shows the history of another Git repository in which better commit messages have been used. This history already gives a good overview about the activities.

[source,text]
----
include::res/message/good.txt[]
----

The above example also adds the corresponding bug number to the
commit message. Some teams (like the Eclipse platform team) use this
approach, others prefer to add
the bug number to the commit messages.
