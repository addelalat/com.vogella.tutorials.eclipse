== Exercise: Git user configuration for the Eclipse IDE

=== Validate your Git user settings

Before using Git the first time, you need to configure your user and email address for the usage of Git.

In your Eclipse IDE, select the menu:Window[Preferences>Team>Git>Configuration] entry.
Ensure that your full name and email is available in the user settings.

The user is stored under the `user.name` key with the full name as value.
If it is not available press the btn:[Add Entry...] button and add it.
Repeat the procedure for your email address via the  `user.email` key.

=== Configure Git to rebase during pull operations

Unless you have a different opinion about rebase and merge commits, also set the `branch.autosetuprebase` parameter to `always`.
This is common setting for Git repositories.  
It avoids merge commits if you pull from a remote repository and have divergent changes and instead rebases your local branch on the remote branch it tracks.


=== Configuring the proxy settings

If you are using a proxy server, you can configure it via menu:Windows[Preferences >General > Network Connection].

=== Validate the setup

After this setup, the configuration should look similar to the following screenshot.
