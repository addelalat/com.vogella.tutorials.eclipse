== Exercise: Working with a local Git repository in Eclipse

=== Target: Using Eclipse Git for a local repository

The following section explains how to create a local Git
repository for
one
project with Eclipse. This allows you
to keep
track
of your changes in the project and allows you to
revert to another
state at a
later
point in time.

=== Create a new Git repository via Eclipse

Open the
_Git Repositories_
view and select the
_Create a new Git repository and add it to this view_
option.

Select a new directory outside of your workspace. By convention this
directory should be a subdirectory in the
_git_
folder of the users home directory.

If you press the
btn:[Finish] button this dialog creates the directory and adds a reference to the
new Git
repository
to the
_Git Repositories_
view.

=== Create .gitignore file

You want to configure Git to ignore the generated bin folder with the
class files. Create for this purpose a _.gitignore_ file in your Git repository with the following content. 

[NOTE]
====
Unfortunately Eclipse Git does not allow to create a file directly in the repository. 
You have to do this step outside of the Eclipse IDE, either via the command line or via your system project explorer.
====

[source,text]
----
include::res/gitignore/gitignore[]
----

All files and directories which apply to the pattern described in this file will be ignored by Git. 
In this example all files in the_bin_are ignored.


NOTE:You can also configure Eclipse to automatically ignore derived resources, e.g., class files via the
menu:Window[Preferences > Team > Git > Projects > Automatically ignore derived resources ..] setting.

=== Creating an Eclipse project

Create a new Java project called `com.vogella.git.first` in Eclipse. 
Create the `com.vogella.git.first` package and the following class.

[source,java]
----
include::res/gitfirst/GitTest.java[]
----

=== Put project under version control

To put your new project under version control with Git, right-click on your project, select menu:Team[Share Project > Git].

Depending on your installation you may have to select that you want to use Git as a version control system.

On the next dialog select your existing Git repository from the drop-down list and press the btn:[Finish] button.

This moves the project to your Git repository. 
The following screenshot shows the generated directory structure. 
The `.git` directory contains the Git repository, the other directories contain the files of the working tree.

=== Using the Git Staging view for the initial commit

Open the _Git Staging_ view, if it is not yet open via menu:Window[Show View > Other... > Git > Git Staging].
In this view drag all files into the _Staged Changes_area, write a meaningful commit message and press the commit button.

=== Using the Git Staging view for committing changes

Change the `System.out.println` message in your `GitTest` class.

[source,java]
----
include::res/change/GitTest.java[]
----

Create a new file called `Readme.md`.

Commit the changes of the `GitTest` class but do not add and commit the `Readme.md` file to the Git repository.

In the _Git Staging_view drag only the `GitTest` class into the _Staged Changes_area, write a meaningful commit message and press the commit button.

This change is now also stored in your local _Git_repository. 
The _Readme.md_file is neither staged nor committed to the Git repository.

=== Commit more files

Commit the `Readme.md` file. 
By now you should know that you have to stage the file and commit it.

=== Review your commit history via the History view

Open the _History_ view to browse the commit history of your repository. 
Review which files were included in your individual commits.

In the
_History_
view click all toggle buttons as shown in the
screenshot (Link with Editor and Selection, Show
all
changes in repository
containing the
selected
resources, Compare Mode, Show all Branches and Tags)

=== Open an older version of a file via the History view

Open the version for the first commit of `GitTest` via the _History_view.

=== Add more projects to your Git repository

You can of course have more than one Eclipse project in your Git repository.
To validate that, create two more Java projects called `com.vogella.egit.multi.java1` and_`com.vogella.egit.multi.java2`. 
Create at least one Java class in each project.

Afterwards select both projects, right-click on them and select menu:Team[Share Project... > Git]. 
If asked by the Eclipse IDE, select that you want to use Git.

Select your Git repository you created in this exercise and add both projects to this repository.
Press the btn:[Finish] button.

=== Validate the project move and commit changes

Afterwards validate that the projects have been moved. 
You can checking your workspace directory and your Git repository directory via a file explorer. 
You see that the projects have been moved from there original location to the Git repository.

The changes have not yet been commit. 
Now commit all files in the two projects to your Git repository.
