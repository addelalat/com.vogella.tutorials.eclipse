[[develop_another_feature_and_use_staging_view]]
== Develop another feature using the Staging View

[[_create_another_local_feature_branch_and_check_it_out_target]]
===Target of this exercise
		
In this exercise you learn how work on multiple features in parallel. 

[[create_another_local_feature_branch_and_check_it_out]]
=== Create another local Feature Branch and check it out
		
When you develop independent things in parallel, you should develop them in different local branches. 
This way you isolate the changes via branches.
Make sure to set the starting point of these branches correctly. 
Right-click on your Project and select menu:Team[Switch to>New branch].
Select as _source ref the remote tracking branch `refs/remotes/origin/master`. 
Use _addPowerOperation_ as branch name. 
Check the _Checkout new branch_ checkbox and press the _Finish_ button.

This creates and checkouts a new branch which starts where the remote tracking branch `refs/remotes/origin/master` points to.

[[_develop_the_new_feature]]
=== Develop the new feature
		
Develop a `Power` class similar to the `Plus` class in the package `org.eclipse.example.calc.internal.operations`.
This should be done in the _org.eclipse.example.calc_ project.
Register the new class in the `Calculator.setupDefaultOperations()` method.

[[_do_a_undesired_modification]]
=== Do a undesired modification
		
Sometimes you want to locally change a file but don&#8217;t want this modification to
			be included in the next commit.
			E.g. certain project modifications are
			important to you but others shouldn&#8217;t see them. To simulate
			this
			right-click on
			your project and select
			<emphasis>Properties &gt; FindBugs</emphasis>
			and select the button
			<emphasis>Run
				automatically
			</emphasis>
			(only available if FindBugs is installed in your Eclipse).

			<emphasis>Unstaged Changes</emphasis>
			lists those changes which you have done locally

			<emphasis>Staged Changes</emphasis>

			Git Staging view should list three files
