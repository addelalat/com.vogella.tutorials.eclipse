
== Using the History View


=== Use filters and search
		
Ensure you have the  History View open.

With the help of filters and search find out which commits have been done to package `org.eclipse.example.calc.internal`. 
Select a commit and find out who has done this commit which files have been touched in this commit.
Find out how many branches are known which have commits changing `Calculator.java`.
		

=== Actions on Commits
			If you double-click on a file touched by a commit in the History View
			you will get an editor with the content of that file in that commit.
			If you turn on
			_Compare Mode_
			(h) then a compare view opens which
			compares the state of the file during that commit to the state in the
			previous commit. This tells which lines have been changed by a
			certain
			commit.

		Once you have selected a commit in the History View the
			context menu
			offers a lot of operations you can do on a commit.
