			If you double-click on a file touched by a commit in the History View
			you will get an editor with the content of that file in that commit.
			If you turn on
			<emphasis>Compare Mode</emphasis>
			(h) then a compare view opens which
			compares the state of the file during that commit to the state in the
			previous commit. This tells which lines have been changed by a
			certain
			commit.
		</simpara>
		<simpara>Once you have selected a commit in the History View the
			context menu
			offers a lot of operations you can do on a commit.
