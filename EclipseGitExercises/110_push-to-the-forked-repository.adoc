[[_push_to_the_forked_repository]]
== Push to the forked repository

In this exercise you learn how to push commits from your local repository
to a remote repository. You will
reuse
your already cloned repository and add
the fork as another remote repository.

NOTE: Another way to achieve the goal would be
to create a new clone of the forked repository. However, having
everything in one
repository has many advantages. For example, in eclipse you can then easily
checkout versions of your
projects from the two remote repositories

[[_add_a_new_remote]]
=== Add a new remote

Git allows that you have more than one remote repository for a local repository.
In the
local repository you can
address each remote repository by a shortcut.
This shortcut is simply called
`remote`. 
For such a remote several properties can be
specified, e.g. URL, branches to fetch or branches to push. When you
cloned your repository, Bit already created
a default remote called
`origin`. 
You now create a second remote for your fork at Github.

You will need the URL. Copy it to the clipboard from Github.

In the Git Repositories view, select
`Create Remote`
on the
`Remotes`
node of your clone.

In the next dialog, enter a name and select the
_Configure fetch_
radiobutton.

Now press the button
`Change`
next to the URL field.

The URL will be automatically taken from the clipboard in the next dialog.

Press the Finish button. In order to test if everything worked well you can fetch from your new remote.

Even if there is no new commit in the remote repository, the fetch command dcreates the branch
`github/master`
which points to the same commit as the master branch at the remote tracking branch. This is a so-called
remote-tracking-branch.

[[_create_a_new_commit_in_a_new_branch]]
=== Create a new commit in a new branch

Create a new commit in your local repository. You should create the local branch based on the new remote, see
screenshot below.
When you do this, the Git push operation will pushes this branch to the new remote repository per
default.

[[_push_to_remote]]
=== Push to remote

Select
`Push to Upstream`
in the Git Repositories view or
menu:Team[Push to Upstream]
in the Package Explorer or Project Explorer.
Now Github needs your username and password. Note that you could clone
and fetch without
authentication,
but in order to push, you need valid user credentials.

Once you have successfully pushed, you see the following result dialog:

image::github_pushresult.png[pdfwidth=50%, Push result]

By default, Eclipse pushes the currently checked out branch to the branch with the same name in the remote.
Note that Git created a new remote tracking branch:
