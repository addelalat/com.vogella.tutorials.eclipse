[[_fetch_the_latest_state_from_upstream]]
== Fetch the latest state from your remote repository

In this exercise you learn how to use the git fetch command to get the latest state from
a remote repository.
Fetching the
latest state updates the
remote tracking
branches in your local repository. It will not change
your
local
branches or your
working tree.

Before starting to develop a feature or doing a bug-fix you should
fetch the latest state from the central repository.
This will update
the remote tracking branch
`origin/master`
which will be the base
for your local changes.

* Go to the Git Repositories view

* Select your repository and click `Fetch from Upstream`

* The "Fetch Results" dialog displays the result of the fetch action

* If new changes have been fetched it looks like this:

* If you already have the latest state available on the server it
shows the message "everything up to date" and
the list is empty.

Now, after the remote tracking branch
`origin/master`
has been updated,
it is a good basis for creating a new local feature branch.
