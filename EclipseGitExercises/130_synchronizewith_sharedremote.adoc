[[fetch_rebase_and_push_sharerepository]]
== Synchronizing with a share remote repository

In this exercise you learn a typical workflow, when you work with others at the same remote repository.
All developers push to the same branch. 
Typically, this branch has evolved since you started your local feature and a push fails.
Here you learn how you can handle this common situation.

=== Preparation

For this exercise, we use the a new repository at https://github.com/vogella/gittraining-shared.git. 
Clone this repository and import the existing project into your workspace.

Ask the trainers to add you as a coworker to this repository. 
Otherwise you are not authorized to push.

Change one of the existing files and create new files and use the Git Staging view to create a new commit in your local repository.

[[_configure_push]]
=== Configure push

First you have to configure that a push to origin pushes to the master branch. Select `Configure Push...`.
Afterwards press the btn:[Add...] button.

Now enter master into the `Remote branch` field. 
Leave `HEAD` in the `Local branch` field. 
This means that always the currently checked out commit will be pushed to master (and of course all its ancestors which are not yet in the remote repository).

[[_try_to_push_to_origin]]
=== Try to push to origin

Try to push. If you are the first one to push the push is successful. 
If someone else have pushed a commit into the master branch of the central repository your push fails.

Select `Push to Upstream` in the Git Repositories view or`Team &gt; Push to Upstream` in the package explorer.
You should get the following error dialog, in case someone else pushed before you:

image::push_rejected.png[pdfwidth=50%, Push Rejected]

This means that git cannot incorporate your commit into the master branch, because your commit is not based on its latest state. 
You first have to fetch the latest state and rebase your local branch on top of it.

[[_fetch_from_origin_and_rebase]]
=== Fetch from origin and rebase

Fetch the latest change from the remote repository and integrate the latest change into your local repository by merging or rebasing it and resolving any possible merge conflict.

[[_push]]
=== Push

Now you can try to push again. If you are lucky and no other training participant has successfully pushed in the meantime, your push will succeed.
