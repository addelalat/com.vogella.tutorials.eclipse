	<title>Synchronizing with a share remote repository
	In this exercise you learn a typical workflow, when you work with others at the same remote repository.
		All
		developers push to the same branch. Typically this branch has evolved since you started your local feature and a push
		will fail.
		Here you learn how you can handle this common situation.

		<title>Preparation
		
			For this exercise, we use the a new repository at
			<ulink url="https://github.com/vogella/gittraining-shared.git">https://github.com/vogella/gittraining-shared.git</ulink>
			. Clone this repository and import the existing project into your workspace.
		
		Ask the trainers to add you as a coworker to this repository. Otherwise you are not authorized to push.
		
		Change one of the existing files and create new files and use the Git Staging view to create a new commit
			in your
			local repository.

		<title>Configure push
		
			First you have to configure that a push to origin pushes to the master branch. Select
			<emphasis>Configure Push&#8230;</emphasis>
		
		
			<inlinemediaobject>
				<imageobject>
					<imagedata fileref="./images/configure_push_to_master.png" scale="50" />

				<textobject>
					<phrase>Configure Push to Origin</phrase>
				</textobject>
			</inlinemediaobject>
		
		
			Now enter master into the
			<emphasis>Remote branch</emphasis>
			field. Leave
			<emphasis>HEAD</emphasis>
			in the
			<emphasis>Local branch</emphasis>
			field. This means that always the currently checked out
			commit will be pushed to master (and of course all its
			ancestors which are not yet in the remote repository).

	<section id="_try_to_push_to_origin">
		<title>Try to push to origin
		Try to push. If you are the first one to push the push is successful. If someone else have pushed a commit
			into
			the master branch of the central repository your push fails.
		
		
			Select
			<emphasis>Push to Upstream</emphasis>
			in the Git Repositories view or
			<emphasis>Team &gt; Push to Upstream</emphasis>
			in the package explorer.
			You should get the following error dialog, in case someone else pushed before you:
		
		
			<inlinemediaobject>
				<imageobject>
					<imagedata fileref="./images/push_rejected.png" scale="50" />
				</imageobject>
				<textobject>
					<phrase>Push Rejected</phrase>
				</textobject>
			</inlinemediaobject>
		
		This means that git cannot incorporate your commit into the master branch, because your commit is not based
			on
			its
			latest state. You first have to fetch the latest state and rebase your local branch on top of it.

	<section id="_fetch_from_origin_and_rebase">
		<title>Fetch from origin and rebase
		Fetch the latest change from the remote repository and integrate the latest change into your local repository
			by
			merging or rebasing it and resolving any possible merge conflict.

		Now you can try to push again. If you are lucky and no other training participant has successfully pushed in
