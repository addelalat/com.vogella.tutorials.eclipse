
== Stashing changes in Eclipse Git
	Stashing in Git refers to taking all changes made in your working directory and committing them to a separate
		area known as the “stash”. Committing to the stash does not create a new commit on the currently checked out branch
		but instead creates a new stashed commit which includes changes made in the working directory and staged in the index.
		Once stashing in complete the working directory and index are reset to the current branch’s head revision. Stashing is
		common when you want to merge or rebase but don’t want to lose your local uncommitted changes but you aren’t quite
		ready to commit them on the current branch. You can first stash your work, perform the merge or rebase and then apply
		the stash to get the changes back in your working directory. A more in-depth explanation of stashing is available in
		the Git Book.
	
	It includes support for listing, creating, applying, and deleting stashed commits from the Git Repositories
		view.
