[[_introduction]]
=== Handling Submodules in Eclipse
 
All of the actions necessary for handling submodules are available in the _Git Repositories_ view.

To clone a repository including submodules:

* Open the Git Repositories view
* Select the _Clone Repository_ icon on the view’s toolbar
* Select URI and click the btn:[Next] button
* Paste the following value into the URI: field and click the Next &gt; button

* git://github.com/jquery/jquery.git

* jQuery is being used as an example repository since it contains two submodules

* src/sizzle

* test/qunit

* Select the btn:[Next] button on the Branch Selection wizard page

* Check the Clone Submodules box on the Local Destination wizard page and click Finish

* This option is shown in the screenshot below and should always be selected whenever cloning a repository with submodules.

* The cloning operation will be displayed in the Progress view

* Once cloning completes you will see a new Submodules node available in the Git Repositories view that lists all the submodules in the selected repository.  Shown below is the jquery repository cloned in EGit with its two submodules present.

Submodules present in the Git Repositories view have the same actions available on them as top-level repositories.  
You can create branches, switch branches, reset, fetch, pull, and many other options.

[[_adding_a_submodule]]
=== Adding a Submodule

You can add a new submodule to a Git repository by specifying a path in the working directory to place the submodule in and specifying a URL to clone from.  The submodule will be registered in the parent repository’s .gitmodules file as well as the parent repository’s .git/config file.

* Open the Git Repositories view

*Select the Add Submodule option from the context menu on the jquery repository node

* Enter “timeago” in the Submodule Path: field

* Select Next &gt;

* Enter the following into the URI: field

* git://github.com/rmm5t/jquery-timeago.git

* Select Finish

* The cloning operation should appear in the Progress view

* Once cloning completes the time submodule should be visible under the Submodules node as well as the Working Directory folder

* Enter a message in the Commit message section of the dialog

* Check the time node in the Files section of the dialog

* Check the .gitmodules node in the Files section of the dialog

* Click the Commit button

* The new time submodule has now been added to the parent jquery repository

[[_conclusion]]
=== Conclusion

The Update Submodule action available on submodule selections in the Git Repositories view is the most common action you will typically use.  
Each time another developers updates the submodule’s checked out version you will need to run this action after you pull down the changes in the parent repository.
The Sync Submodule action is also available from the Git Repositories view for when the URL of the submodule changes in the .gitmodules file.  
This action copies the URL from the .gitmodules file to the remote config inside the submodule so that pull operations on the submodule repository will use the URL configured for that submodule in the parent repository.
