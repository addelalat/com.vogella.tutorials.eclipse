== Git user configuration for the Eclipse IDE

[[egitconfiguration_username]]
=== Validate your Git user settings

In case you have not used Git before on a computer, you need to configure at least your user and email address for the usage of Git.

In your Eclipse IDE, select the menu:Window[Preferences>Team>Git>Configuration] entry.
Ensure that your full name and email is available in the user settings.

The user is stored under the `user.name` key with the full name as value. 
If it is not available press the _Add Entry..._	button and add it.
Repeat the procedure for your email address via the  `user.email` key.

[[egitconfiguration_autorebase]]
=== Configure Git to rebase during pull operations

Unless you have a different opinion about rebase and merge commits, also set the `branch.autosetuprebase` parameter to `always`.
This is common setting for Git repositories.  
It avoids merge commits if you pull from a remote repository and have divergent changes and instead rebases your local branch on the remote branch it tracks.


[[egitconfiguration_validate]]
=== Validate the setup

After this setup, the configuration should look similar to the following screenshot.
