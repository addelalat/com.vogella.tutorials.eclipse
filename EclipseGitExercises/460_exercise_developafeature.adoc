== Develop a new feature or a bug fix

In this exercise you will learn how to develop a new feature using Git in Eclipse.
	

=== Create a local feature branch
		
The development of a new feature (or bug-fix) should normally only depend on the submitted state of the project.
It should not depend on other pending changes that might or might not pass the code review. 
This is why new features or bug-fixes should be developed in isolation on its own branch. 
This branch is usually created based on the latest state of the master branch available on the remote repository used for integrating the changes of different developers.
This is the remote tracking branch called `origin/master` in your local clone.
		
		
Go to the _Git Repositories_ view.
		
		
Right click on menu:Branches[Remote Tracking>origin/master] and select _Create Branch_.

In the new branch dialog:

* enter a name for the local feature branch into the _Branch Name_ field (this is just a local name that is not exposed to anybody else)
* ensure that the _Pull Strategy_ is set to _Rebase_
* keep the _Checkout new branch_ flag selected
* confirm the dialog by clicking on the _Finish_ button

This creates and checks out the new branch.

=== Develop a new feature

Start editing the source code and implement a new feature. 
In this example project implement a divide operation.
		
For this, create a new class called `Divide.java` in the  `org.eclipse.example.calc.internal.operations` package.
This class should implements the interface `org.eclipse.example.calc.BinaryOperation` and extends the  `org.eclipse.example.calc.internal.operations.AbstractOperation` class.

To register the new operation add a corresponding line to the `Calculator.setupDefaultOperations` method.

You may also decide to implement something else like polish the SWT or Swing user interface.



== Test your feature

Run the unit tests to ensure that you did not break anything.

=== Commit your changes locally
		
Use the Git staging view to store your development in your local repository in your current branch by committing your changes.
		
Enter a commit message explaining why the change was done.
Stage all files that you want to commit and click the btn:[Commit] button.

As result your changes are committed in your local repository
