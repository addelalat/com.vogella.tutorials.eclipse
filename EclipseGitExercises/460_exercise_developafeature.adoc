== Develop something

=== Create a local feature branch
		
Go to the _Git Repositories_ view.
Right click on menu:Branches[Remote Tracking>origin/master] and select _Create Branch_.

In the new branch dialog:

* enter a name for the local feature branch into the _Branch Name_ field (this is just a local name that is not exposed to anybody else)
* ensure that the _Pull Strategy_ is set to _Rebase_
* keep the _Checkout new branch_ flag selected
* confirm the dialog by clicking on the btn:[Finish] button

This creates and checks out the new branch.

=== Develop a new feature

Start editing the source code and implement a new feature. 
In this example you implement a divide operation.

[NOTE]
====
It is not necessary to correctly implement the divide operation to learn the usage of Git.
Feel free to do other changes, e.g., a change in a code comment.
====
		
For this, create a new class called `Divide.java` in the  `org.eclipse.example.calc.internal.operations` package.
This class should:

* implements the interface `org.eclipse.example.calc.BinaryOperation` and 
* extends the  `org.eclipse.example.calc.internal.operations.AbstractOperation` class.

To register the new operation add a corresponding line to the `Calculator.setupDefaultOperations` method.

=== Test your new developed feature

Run the unit tests to ensure that you did not break anything.

[[commit_your_changes_locally]]
=== Commit your changes locally

Use the Staging View to commit your changes in your current branch.
Open the staging view by selecting menu:Window[Show View> Other… > Git Staging].
Verify that `Author` and `Committer` contain both your full name and your correct e-mail address in the following format:

[source]
----
John Doe <john.doe@example.org>
----

[NOTE]
====
If author and committer are not preset correctly you need to change the Git configuration parameters `user.name` and/or `user.email`.
In this case cancel the dialog and open menu:Window[Preferences > Team > Git > Configuration > User Settings].
Correct the values for `user.name` and `user.email`.
====


* Select all files that you want to commit
* Enter a commit message explaining why the change was done
* Click `Commit`. 

As result your changes are committed in your `local` repository

== Develop another feature

In this exercise you learn how work on multiple features in parallel. 

=== Create another local feature branch and check it out
		
Right-click on your Project and select menu:Team[Switch to>New branch].
Select as source ref the remote tracking branch `refs/remotes/origin/master`. 
Use `addPowerOperation` as branch name. 
Check the _Checkout new branch_ checkbox and press the btn:[Finish] button.

This creates and checkouts a new branch which starts where the remote tracking branch `refs/remotes/origin/master` points to.

=== Develop another new feature
		
Develop a `Power` class similar to the `Plus` class in the package `org.eclipse.example.calc.internal.operations`.
This should be done in the _org.eclipse.example.calc_ project.
Register the new class in the `Calculator.setupDefaultOperations()` method.

=== Do a undesired modification
		
Sometimes you want to locally change a file but do not want this modification to be included in the next commit.
E.g. certain project modifications are important to you but others should not see them. 
To simulate this right-click on your project and select menu:Properties[FindBugs] and select the button btn:[Run automatically].

[NOTE]
====
This option is only available, if FindBugs is installed in your Eclipse.
If you did not install Findbugs, simply create a new text file.
====

=== Open the Git Staging view and inspect the status
		
If the staging view is closed, reopen it by selecting menu:Window[Show View > Other… > Git Staging].
		
Git Staging view should list three files:

* `.project`
* `Calculator.java`
* `Power.java`

`.project` appears only if you have configured FindBugs to run automatically.
		
image::staging-view.png[Staging view[]
		
Double-click on `.project`to inspect which changes you have done. 
This opens the _Compare_ editor for this file.
		
image::staging-view-2.png[Staging view[]
		
Drag and drop `Calculator.java` and `Power.java` to the _Staged Changes_ area.
This marks them to be included in the next commit.
		
image::staging-view-3.png[Staging view[]

=== Commit your change
		
In the _Git Staging_ view enter a commit message in the _Commit message_ field and click on the btn:[Commit] button.
		
image::staging-view-4.png[Staging view[]

=== Cleanup
		
After inspecting your recent change, you decide that this change should be reverted. 
Revert your change by right-clicking on the _`.project`_ file in the _Git Staging_ view. 
Select the `Replace with File in Git Index` entry.
