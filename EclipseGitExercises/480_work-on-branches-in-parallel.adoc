== Work on branches in parallel
	
In this exercise you learn how to change commits using the `amend` option of Git for commits.
This is for example useful if you work in different branches in parallel and you want to temporarily save your work. 
You can commit an unfinished change and later on replace this commit with a new, refined commit using the `amend` option of Git.


=== Start working on another feature
		
Create a new local branch based on the remote tracking branch `origin/master`. 
You can do this as described in <<egitexercise_create_a_local_feature_branch>> or you can use the _History_	view as described in this chapter.
		
		
Create a new branch from the _History_ view.

Enter "addMultiplyOperation" as the name of the new branch. 
Make sure the _checkout new branch_	checkbox is selected and click on the btn:[Finish] button.
		
Ensure that you don’t see the changes of the first exercise anymore in your workspace.
		
		
Start working on a change, e.g. add a `Multiply` operation, do not commit yet, first read on.

=== Switch branches

Now you want to switch to another branch but you want to continue working at your new feature later on. 
The easiest thing to do is to just commit your work in progress and change that commit later on.
Use the _Git Staging_ view to enter a preliminary message, e.g. "[Unfinished] Add multiply operation", stage the files and click the btn:[Commit] button.
				
				
Now you can switch to the first feature branch "addDivideOperation". 
This can be done by double clicking on the branch node in the Git Repositories View via the context menu by selecting menu:Team[Switch To addDivideOperation].
Alternatively you can also select the _Checkout_ entry from the context menu on the "addDivideOperation" branch in the History View.
				
				
Check that your workspace contains the changes you committed in your first feature (implementing divide) branch. 
You could now continue working here. 
For example: you may want to fix the division by zero issue if it is not already handled. 
If you do any changes in the "addDivideOperation" branch don’t forget to commit them with amend before the next step
				
				
Switch back to the "addMultiplyOperation" branch


=== Continue working on the branch adding Multiply
				
Do another change in the workspace improving Multiply.
				
Compare your changed project with the first, preliminary commit by selecting menu:Compare With[HEAD revision]. 
This shows you the changes you will add on top of the first commit.
				
				
Compare your changed project with the parent commit of your first, preliminary commit by selecting menu:Compare With[Previous revision].
This shows you the changes you will have in your new commit after the next step.
				
Create a new commit with the combined changes of your first, preliminary commit and your current changes by pressing the btn:[Amend] button in the staging view and by adding the new changes.
						
Leave the commit messages as it is, e.g., do not remove the [UNFINISHED] prefix.
						
In the _History_ view you can now see that your first, preliminary commit was replaced by the new one.

=== Fixing the commit message

The amend feature is often used to fix the commit message of what you just committed.

Now, change the commit message to something meaningful (e.g remove [UNFINISHED]) and click the btn:[Commit] button.		
				
In order to change the commit message of the last commit, press the btn:[Amend] button in the _Git Staging_ view.
Change the commit message and press the btn:[Commit] button.
