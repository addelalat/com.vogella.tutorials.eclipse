== Merge, Rebase and resolving conflicts


=== Target
In this exercise you learn how to combine the work done in different branches and how to resolve the conflicts which can occur during that process.


=== Create a conflicting commit

You may skip this step if you have already created conflicting changes in the previous exercises. 
This is the case if you touched exactly the same line of the same file in different feature branches. 
If this is not the case please do the following:
		
Create a new local branch based on the remote tracking branch `origin/master`.

Do a different change in the same class on the same line as in the other branch.
For example, you may add a class `Multiply` and add a corresponding line to the `setupDefaultOperations` method in the `Calculator` class) and commit this change.

=== Trigger the first merge from the history view
		
Now you would like to have both new features in the master branch.
One possibility to achieve that is to merge the branches into the master branch, one after the other. 
Later in this exercise you will use the other option, the _rebase_ operation.
		
Ensure that you have checked out the  `master` branch where you want to have the merged state, i.e. where the merge commit will be
created.
				
				
In the History View, select _Merge_ from in the context menu of the `addDivideOperation` branch. 
This merges the content of the`addDivdeOperation` branch into the `master` branch. 
Since there was no work done on the `master` branch and `addDivideOperation` points to a successor commit of the commit in
master Git simply advances the `master`	branch to the same commit as the `addDivideOperation `branch. 
Inspect this in the History View.

=== Trigger the second merge
				
In the History View, select _Merge_	in the context menu of the branch which contains the conflicting commit. 
This merges the	content of this branch into the `master` branch. 
This time the merge operation should  end with a conflicts.

=== Resolving merge conflicts

If a merge generates conflicts the repository is in a special state. 
The conflicts have to be resolved until normal work can go on.
		
You can find the conflicting files by the conflict decorator in the package explorer:

If there are many conflicts it may be easier to find them in the Git Staging View:

If you open the conflicting file in an editor you will find the conflict markers there. 
You can directly edit the file here.

You may use the Merge tool to resolve the conflicts:
				
				
Select menu:Team[Merge Tool].
You see a dialog where you can configure the initial state of the left hand side of the editor.
Which one you choose depends on your preference.
In the first case youâ€™ll already get the state which was merged by Git. 
In the second case you get the version before the merge operation.
The first option is useful, if Git could already merge most of the changes automatically and only a small number of conflicts is left.
With the second option you get a better overview of the changes in both branches.

Edit the left side until you are happy with the change and save.

Use the _Git Staging_ view to stage the files  which had conflicts. 
When you have done it for all such files the repository state changes from _Conflicts_ to _Merged_. 
Press the btn:[Commit] button in the _Git Staging_ view. 
Note that there is already a commit message proposed by Git. Leave it as it is.
				

=== Undo the merge with with the git reset operation
		
After you have done a merge as described above assume that you do not want the merge commit in your branch anymore.
You can easily undo the merge with the reset operation. 
he same can also be done if the merge is not finished but your repository is in state `Conflicting` or `Merged`.
		
To undo the merge, select menu:Reset[Hard] on the commit where the branch pointed to before you did the second merge.

In case you do that when you have an unfinished merge the screenshot looks like this:
