=== Rebasing a branch onto another

Now do a rebase of the conflicting commit instead of a merge.
		
In the History View, select _Rebase on Top of_ from the context menu on the second feature branch (the first one is checked out):

The rebase stops because of a conflict. You see a dialog:

Click _OK_ to start the merge tool.
				
Click _OK_ to start conflict resolution (using pre-merged option).

Edit the left side until you are happy with the change and save

Use the Git Staging View to do this in one step by drag and drop
				
				
In the Repositories View select your repository and click menu:Rebase[Continue].

Now the version graph should look like this:

Note that there is a reference called `ORIG_HEAD` pointing to the commit which was checked out before the rebase operation. 
You may revert the rebase operation with reset as described above.

[TIP]
====
You may hide or show the additional references such as `ORIG_HEAD`	and	`FETCH_HEAD` from the History View by selecting menu:Show[Additional Refs] in the drop-down menu.

=== Using interactive rebase to edit the commit message
		
Reword on of your commit messages via a right-click on it in the _History_ view and select menu:Modify[Reword]to change the commit message.


=== Squash two commits

Do another commit by adding a comment in the code to your last change. Commit this change via a new commit.
		
You realize that you wanted to combine the last two commits. 
Use the _History_ view to combine them.
You can squash several commits by selecting them in the _History_ view and by using the menu:Modify[Squash]	menu entry from the context menu.

=== Remove a commit
		
Do two more commits, A followed by B. 
You want to remove the commit A from your history. 
Use the interactive rebase to perform this operation.
