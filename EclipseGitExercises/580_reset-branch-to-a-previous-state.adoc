== Reset branch to a previous state

Accidentally committing changes in a wrong branch can happen.
For example you may switch between several branches, forget to checkout the branch in which you plan to continue your work and then commit in a wrong branch. 
Resetting the wrongly updated branch to its previous state is the topic of this exercise.

Suppose you want to fix the warning for the unused `serialVersionUID` field in the SWT `org.eclipse.example.calc.internal.ui.swt.CalculatorUI` class.

You create a new local branch for this purpose _fixWarnings_. 
However, let’s pretend that you forgot to checkout the _fixWarnings_ branch. 
Instead you are on the _addDivideOperation_.

To simulate that,create a new branch called _fixWarnings_ based on the _origin/master_branch. 
But make sure the_checkout new branch_checkbox is deselected. 
The new branch gets created but the _addDivideOperation_ branch is still checked out.

Remove the field _serialVersionUID_ from _org.eclipse.example.calc.internal.ui.swt.CalculatorUI_. 
Commit the changes. 
This updates the _addDivideOperation_ branch.

Realize that you committed changes in a wrong branch. Don’t panic.

Reset the _addDivideOperation_ branch back to its previous state but keep the changes in the working tree. 
You can do this, via the _History View_. 
Find the parent commit of the tip of the _addDivideOperation_ branch and select menu:Reset[Mixed] from the context menu.

The _addDivideOperation_ branch is reset back to its previous state and doesn’t contain the commit that fixed the warning anymore.
However, the fix for the warning is still in the working tree!
				
Now, checkout the correct branch, the _fixWarnings_ branch.
The changes are still in the working tree. 
Commit the changes.
