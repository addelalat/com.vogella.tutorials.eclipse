== Change a series of commits

In this exercise you learn how you can rewrite the local history before you share it with others. 
After you have committed locally you can still change all commits in your local feature branch.

=== Preparation

Follow the exercise merge-rebase-and-resolving-conflicts.html[ Merge, Rebase and Resolving Conflicts. 
After the rebase you end up with a branch which is two commits ahead of the remote branch _origin/master_, it&#8217;s the local _master_ branch in the screenshot below. 
Now you realize that you want to change the first commit and keep the second one on top of the changed commit.

=== Change the first commit

* Create a new branch that points to the commit you want to change, in the screenshot below it is the `Add multiply operation` commit. 
Use _Create Branch_to create a new branch, e.g. named `newMaster`.

* Edit the files in the workspace, e.g. add a class comment for the _Multiply_class.

* Now create a new commit with the combined changes of your first
commit and your current changes. 
Use the Amend option in the Staging view for this.

* Now your history should look like this:

Note that the first version of your changed commit is still
there, but
your branch points now to the new one.
Git always creates new commits
when you rewrite history, it does not change old ones (from time to
time it removes
commits which are not reachable by a reference,
e.g.
a branch or a tag).

=== Cherry-pick the rest

* Select _Cherry Pick_ on the other commit. 
This adds the difference of this commit compared to its parent on top of your new commit.

* You may have to resolve conflicts

In that case, edit the conflicting files, add the changes and commit.

* The result should look like this:

If you want to change more than one commit in a series Git offers the interactive rebase.
