
== Use the git blame feature
	
Using the History View and filtering the history is a useful tool for inspecting the project history. 
However, if you look at a particular file and find a bug in a particular line of code you would like to instantly know who was the last person who changed this line of code.
Additionally, you would like to know why the developer did that i.e. locate the commit in which the change was done.
	
In Git, this feature is called _git blame_ or _git annotate_.
	
			
In Eclipse open a file for which you would like to see the Git annotations. 
For example, open the _Calculator.java_ from the example project.
			
Right-click the left margin in the editor and choose _Show Annotations_.

A new _annotations_ column appears in the editor window
			
Right click the _annotations_ column and choose _Revisions &gt; Show Author_

Now, for each line of the code you know who last changed it
			

Keep the mouse over an annotation for a couple of seconds. 
A window pops up showing the info about the commit in which this line was changed.

Click on the commit-id in order to see full details of the commit.
