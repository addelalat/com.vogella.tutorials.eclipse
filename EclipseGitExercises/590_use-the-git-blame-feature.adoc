== Use the git blame feature
	
In Eclipse open a file for which you would like to see the Git _blame_ information, e.g., to see who changed which line. 

For example, open the _Calculator.java_ from the example project.			
Right-click the left margin in the editor and choose _Show Revision Information_. 

NOTE: Older Eclipse versions called that entry _Show Annotations_.

A column appears in the editor window
Right click the _annotations_ column and choose menu:Revisions[Show Author].

Now, for each line of the code you know who last changed it
			

Keep the mouse over an annotation for a couple of seconds. 
A window pops up showing the info about the commit in which this line was changed.

Click on the commit-id in order to see full details of the commit.
