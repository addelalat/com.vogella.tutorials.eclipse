== Create Github user and fork repository

In the following exercises you work with remote repositories.
First you learn how to work with a repository where only you have write access. 
Such a repository can easily be created at Github.

In Github there are two ways to get a repository.

* Create a new one and push the initial content from a local repository
* Create a copy of an existing repository hosted at Github. 
In Github, this is called _Forking_ or creating a _fork_.

As we have already worked with a local clone of a Github repository, this exercise uses the second approach.

[[Sign_up_at_github]]
=== Sign up at Github

Before you can fork a repository at Github, you need to have a account. In case you do not have already a Github
user,
open
http://www.github.com[http://www.github.com]
in a browser. Enter a username, an e-mail adress and a password.
The e-mail address should match the address you used
for the git setup; Github uses the e-mail
address to identify the author of a commit.
