== Create Github user and fork repository

=== Target of this exercise

In the following exercises you work with remote repositories.
First you learn how to work with a repository where only you have write access. 
Such a repository can easily be created at Github.
		
In Github there are two ways to get a repository.
				
* Create a new one and push the initial content from a local repository
				
* Create a copy of an existing repository hosted at Github. 
In Github, this is called _Forking_ of creating a _fork_.
				
As we have already worked with a local clone of a Github repository, this exercise uses the second approach.


=== Sign up at Github
		
Before you can fork a repository at Github, you need to have a account.

NOTE: The Github UI may change over time.
 
In case you do not have already a Github user,  open http://www.github.com in a browser. 
Press the _Sign up" button and enter a username, an e-mail adress and a password.
The e-mail address should match the address you used for the Git setup; Github uses the e-mail address to identify the author of a commit.

=== Fork the Repository
Once you have signed up you can fork an existing repository. 	
In order to fork a repository open the following URL: https://github.com/vogellacompany/gittraining-sample

If you are logged into Github, press the _Fork_ button and create your own copy of the repository.

You have now created your own copy of the training repository on Github.
