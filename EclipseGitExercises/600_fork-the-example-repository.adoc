[[fork_the_example_repository_on_github]]== Create Github user and fork repository=== Target of this exerciseIn the following exercises you work with remote repositories.First you learn how to work with arepository whereonly you havewrite access. Such a repository can easily be created at Github.In Github there are two ways to get a repository.* Create a new one and push the initial content from a local repository* Create a copy of an existing repository hosted at Github. In Github, this is called_Forking_of creating a_fork_.As we have already worked with a local clone of a Github repository, this exercise uses the second approach.[[Sign_up_at_github]]=== Sign up at GithubBefore you can fork a repository at Github, you need to have a account. In case you do not have already a Githubuser,openhttp://www.github.com[http://www.github.com]in a browser. Enter a username, an e-mail adress and a password.The e-mail address should match the address you usedfor the git setup; Github uses the e-mailaddress to identify the author of a commit.image::githubstart.png[Sign up at Github][[_fork_the_repository]]=== Fork the RepositoryIn order to fork a repository open the following URL: https://github.com/vogellacompany/gittraining-sampleIf you are logged into Github, press the _Fork_ button and create your own copy of the repository.		[TIP]====You need to be logged into Github and at the https://github.com/vogellacompany/gittraining-sample URL.Forking is done via the website.====image::fork-button2.png[Fork Button][NOTE]====You could also search for repo via the Search functionality of Github.====You have now created your own copy of the training repository on Github.
