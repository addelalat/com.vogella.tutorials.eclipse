In this exercise you will learn how to develop a new feature using Git in Eclipse.

=== Create a local feature branch
		
The development of a new feature (or bug-fix) should normally only depend on the submitted state of the project.
It should not depend on other pending changes that might or might not pass the code review. 
This is why new features or bug-fixes should be developed in isolation on its own branch. 
This branch is usually created based on the latest state of the master branch available on the remote repository used for integrating the changes of different developers.
This is the remote tracking branch called `origin/master` in your local clone.

[[_develop_a_new_feature]]
=== Develop a new feature

Start editing the source code and implement a new feature. 
In this example project implement a divide operation.
		
For this, create a new class called `Divide.java` in the  `org.eclipse.example.calc.internal.operations` package.
This class should implements the interface `org.eclipse.example.calc.BinaryOperation` and extends the  `org.eclipse.example.calc.internal.operations.AbstractOperation` class.

To register the new operation add a corresponding line to the `Calculator.setupDefaultOperations` method.

You may also decide to implement something else like polish the SWT or Swing user interface.


[[_commit_your_changes_locally]]
=== Commit your changes locally

Use `git add` and `git commit` to store your development in your local repository in your current branch by committing your changes.
		
Enter a commit message explaining why the change was done.
Stage all files that you want to commit and click the _Commit_ button.

As result your changes are committed in your local repository, validate that via the `git log` command.
