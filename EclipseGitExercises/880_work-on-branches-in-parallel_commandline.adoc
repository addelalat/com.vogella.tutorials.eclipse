[[_work_on_branches_in_parallel]]
== Work on branches in parallel
	
In this exercise you learn how to change commits using the `amend` option of Git for commits.
This is for example useful if you work in different branches in parallel and you want to temporarily save your work. 
You can commit an unfinished change and later on replace this commit with a new, refined commit using the `amend` option of Git.

[[start_working_on_another_feature]]
=== Start working on another feature
		
Create a new local branch called `addMultiplyOperation` based on the remote tracking branch `origin/master`. 

Ensure that you don’t see the changes of the first exercise anymore in your workspace.
		
		
Start working on a change, e.g. add a `Multiply` operation, do not commit yet, first read on.

[[_switch_branches]]
=== Switch branches

Now you want to switch to another branch but you want to continue working at your new feature later on. 
The easiest thing to do is to just commit your work in progress and change that commit later on.

Use the `git add` and the `git commit` command to commmit the changes with  a preliminary message, e.g. "[Unfinished] Add multiply operation".
				
				
Now you can switch to the first feature branch "addDivideOperation" with the `git checkout addDivideOperation` command.

				
Check that your workspace contains the changes you committed in your first feature (implementing divide) branch. 
You could now continue working here. 
For example: you may want to fix the division by zero issue if it is not already handled. 
If you do any changes in the "addDivideOperation" branch don’t forget to commit them with amend before the next step
				
				
Switch back to the "addMultiplyOperation" branch with the `git checkout addDivideOperation` command.

[[continue_working_on_the_branch_adding_multiply]]
=== Continue working on the branch adding Multiply
				
Do another change in the Java class Multiply to improve it.
				
Compare your changed project with the first, preliminary commit with the `git diff` command.
This shows you the changes you will add on top of the first commit.
				
				
Compare your changed project with the parent commit of your first, preliminary commit with the `git diff HEAD~` command.
This shows you the changes you will have in your new commit after the next step.
				
Create a new commit with the combined changes of your first, preliminary commit and your current changes by using the `git add` and `git commit --amend command.
						
						
Use `git log` to review the commit history. See that your first, preliminary commit was replaced by the new one.

[[_fixing_the_commit_message]]
=== Fixing the commit message

The amend feature is often used to fix the commit message of what you just committed.

Now, change the commit message to something meaningful (e.g remove [UNFINISHED]) and via the `git commit --amend -m "New commit message".		

Use `git log` to review the commit history. See that your first, preliminary commit was replaced by the new one.
