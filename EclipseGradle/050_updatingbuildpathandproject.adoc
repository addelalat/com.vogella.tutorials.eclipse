== Updating the Gradle build path and project conversion

=== Updating Eclipse with the latest changes in the Gradle build file

Eclipse does currently not automatically update the classpath if the `build.gradle` file is updated. 
Select menu:Gradle[Refresh Gradle Project] from the context menu of the project for that.

This should be simpler.

=== Add Gradle support to existing Eclipse project

Currently the Gradle tooling for Eclipse does not offer the option to convert an existing project to Gradle. 
The easiest way to convert an existing project is currently to delete the project from the current workspace, to add a build.gradle file and to import it via the Gradle import wizard.

Please add a comment to https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=465355[Provide option to convert an Eclipse project to Gradle] in case you want to have project conversion better supported by the Eclipse Gradle tooling.
