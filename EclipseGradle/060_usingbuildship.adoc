== Using the Gradle Tasks view

After successfully importing a Gradle project, the project is shown in the _Gradle Tasks_ view.

By right clicking on a certain Gradle task in the Gradle Tasks view, you can run the selected Gradle task.

By default the result is displayed in the _Gradle Executions_ view. 
It is also displayed in the _Console_ view similar to the output you would get if you run the task via the command line.

[WARNING]
====
The _Gradle Executions_ view can only be used, if you use Gradle 2.4 or higher.
