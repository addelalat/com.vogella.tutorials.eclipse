== OSGi resource bundles
(((i18n,OSGi resource bundles)))
For the translation of the plugin.xml and application model files the
Eclipse runtime uses by default OSGi
resource
bundles.
These are
property
files in a specified location. OSGi
expects at least one resource bundle in this
location.
	
_OSGI-INF/l10n/bundle_
is the default location and file prefix which the Eclipse translation service is using.
Via the
_Bundle-Localization_
attribute in the
manifest
file, you can specify an alternative location for the bundle resources. The usage of this
attribute is demonstrated in
the following
listing.
	
[source,text]
----
include::res/plugin/MANIFEST.MF[]
----
	
Alternative languages are
defined
via
additional property
files. The
filename of these files can
include a language and optional
a country
variant as described in
<<i18n_propertyfiles>>
. For example
_bundle_en.properties_
or
_bundle_en_UK.properties_.
