== Translating SWT and JFace code

The SWT and JFace plug-ins include their resource translation
files. You can change these default texts and their
translations
because resource
bundles have an override support built in.

If you
supply
a different file
of the SWT or JFace translation
bundles in
a
fragment or
plug-in
(such as
SWTMessage_de.properties),
then
the most
local bundle
matching
the
current locale is used.

To change the text supplied by SWT and JFace do the following:

* Create two fragments projects, which will hold the translations. One with org.eclipse.jface and one with org.eclipse.swt as
Host-Plug-in.
* Create the
`org.eclipse.jface`
and
`org.eclipse.swt.internal`
packages in the corresponding fragments.
* Copy the
_org/eclipse/jface/message.properties_
file from the org.eclipse.jface plug-in and the
_org/eclipse/swt/internal/SWTMessage.properties_
file
from the SWT plug-in to
the
corresponding packages in your
project. See the appendix for the links to their
location in the
Eclipse Git repository.
* Provide the files with your desired language extensions, e.g.
message_de.properties.
* Edit the files to contain your text properties.

WARNING: The original
_message.properties_
in JFace or
_SWTMessage.properties_
in SWT cannot be overridden by a
fragment.
Therefore, you can only
provide additional
_*.properties_
files
for a
certain locale like
message_de.properties.

You can translate selected
properties of the
original
_message.properties_
file.
The
following listing shows how you
would override the buttons of a
JFace
`Wizard`
class in a
_message_de.properties_
file.
