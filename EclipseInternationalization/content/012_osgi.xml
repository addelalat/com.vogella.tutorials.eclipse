		For the translation of the plugin.xml and application model files the
		Eclipse runtime uses by default OSGi
		resource
		bundles.
		These are
		property
		files in a specified location. OSGi
		expects at least one resource bundle in this
		location.
	

	
		_OSGI-INF/l10n/bundle_
		is the default location and file prefix which the Eclipse translation service is using.
		Via the
		<parameter>Bundle-Localization</parameter>
		attribute in the
		manifest
		file, you can specify an alternative location for the bundle resources. The usage of this
		attribute is demonstrated in
		the following
		listing.
	

	
		<programlisting>
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="../examples/plugin/MANIFEST.MF" />
		</programlisting>
	


	
		Alternative languages are
		defined
		via
		additional property
		files. The
		filename of these files can
		include a language and optional
		a country
		variant as described in
		<xref linkend="i18n_propertyfiles" />
		. For example
		_bundle_en.properties_
		or
		_bundle_en_UK.properties_
		.
