        The translation key can be specified in your application model via the
        _%key_
        reference. This usage is demonstrated via the following screenshot of the model data for a part.

		Currently the application model tooling includes rudimentary support
		for
		extracting Strings. Press the right mouse button on an empty space
		in the application model
		editor and select
		_Externalize Strings_
		.
	
	<warning>
		
			This action extracts all Strings from the application model. If
			you
			want to replace only a set of relevant Strings, you have to do
			this
			manually. If you do it manually you can use the PDE wizard as
			described in <xref linkend="i18n_plugin" />
			to create the
			<filename>bundle.property</filename>
			file and the OSGi
			reference.
