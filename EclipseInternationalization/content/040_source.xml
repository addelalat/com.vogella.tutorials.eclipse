=== NLS compared to the Eclipse translation service
		<warning>
			
				This part of the description is included for completeness. It describes the NLS approach for translation. This
				approach
				still
				works
				but the Eclipse translation
				mechanism provides
				more flexibility, e.g., dynamic switching of
				languages, less
				memory
				consumption and a translation service which can be exchanged. This
				superior
				approach is
				described
				in
				<xref linkend="eclipse4_i18n1" />
				.

=== Translating your custom code
		
			It is possible to translate the Java source with two different
			approaches, based on Strings and based on constants.
			The approach
			based on constants is more reliable and should be preferred. To
			enable
			this support you need to configure
			the
			<code>org.eclipse.core.runtime</code>
			plug-in as dependency in your related plug-in.
		
		
			To translate Strings in the source code, select the file you want to
			translate and
			select
			menu:Source[Externalize Strings]
			.

			Please note that the
			_Use Eclipse's string externalization mechanism_
			option is only visible if you have the
			<code>org.eclipse.core.runtime</code>
			plug-in configured as a dependency in your plug-in.

			In this wizard you
			can select which Strings should be translated, which should be skipped and
			which should be
			marked
			as not translatable.
		
		
			If you select that a String should not be translated, Eclipse
			marks
			the occurrence with a
			<code>$NON-NLS</code>
			comment in the source code.
		
		
			As the result a
			<code>Messages</code>
			class is generated which serves as an access point for the properties
			file.
		
		
			<programlisting>
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="../examples/source/Messages.java" />
			</programlisting>
		
		
			In this example the
			<code>Messages</code>
			class uses a constant called
			<code>BUNDLE_NAME</code>
			to point to the
			<filename>message*.properties</filename>
			file in the
			<code>test</code>
			package. * is a placeholder for your locale, e.g., _de,_en,
			etc.
		
		
			<programlisting>
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="../examples/source/messages.properties" />
			</programlisting>
		
		
			In your code you access the translations via the
			<code>Message</code>
			class.
		

		
			<programlisting>
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="../examples/source/using.txt" />
			</programlisting>
		
		
			You can also use placeholders in the messages and evaluate them with
			the
			<code>NLS.bind()</code>
			method.

			<programlisting>
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="../examples/source/place2.txt" />
			</programlisting>
		

		 If translations should be used over several plug-ins to ensure consistency,
			it is good practice to create separate
			plug-ins or
			fragments
			for the
			translations. All plug-ins which want to use the translations define
			a
			dependency to
			the
			corresponding
			plug-in.
		
		
			Additional languages are typically contributed via Eclipse
			fragment
			projects to this message plug-in.
