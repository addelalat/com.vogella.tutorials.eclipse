== The Java model and the Java Abstract Syntax Tree

The Eclipse _Java Development Tools_ (JDT) project provides the tools to develop Java applications.
This project also provides APIs to access and manipulate Java source code.

JDT provides access to the Java source code via two different means.
The _Java Model_ and the _Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)_, which works on a _Document Object Model_ similar to the XML DOM.

=== Java Model

Each Java project is internally represented in Eclipse as a Java model.
The Eclipse Java model is a light-weight and fault tolerant representation of the Java project.

It does not contain as many information as the AST but is fast to create.
For example the _Outline_ view is using the Java model for its representation.
This way the information in the _Outline_ view can quickly get updated.

The Java model is defined in the `org.eclipse.jdt.core` plug-in.

The Java model is represented as a tree structure which can be described via the following table.

.Java Model
|===
| Project Element | Java Model element | Description

| Java project
| IJavaProject
| The Java project which contains all other objects.

| src folder / bin folder / or external library
| IPackageFragmentRoot
| Hold source or binary files, can be a folder or a library (zip / jar file )

| Each package
| IPackageFragment
| Each package is below the IPackageFragmentRoot, sub-packages are not leaves of the package, they are listed directly under IPackageFragmentRoot

| Java Source File
| ICompilationUnit
| The Source file is always below the package node

| Types / Fields / Methods
| IType / IField / IMethod
| Types, fields and methods
|===


=== Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)

The AST is a detailed tree representation of the Java source code.
The AST defines an API to modify, create, read and delete source code.

The main package for the AST is the `org.eclipse.jdt.core.dom` package and is located in the `org.eclipse.jdt.core` plug-in.

Each Java source element is represented as a subclass of the `ASTNode` class.
Each specific AST node provides specific information about the object it represents.
For example you have `MethodDeclaration` (for methods), `VariableDeclarationFragment` (for variable declarations) and `SimpleName` (for any string which is not a Java keyword).

The AST is typically created based on a `ICompilationUnit` from the Java Model.
