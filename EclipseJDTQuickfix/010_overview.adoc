== Developing custom Eclipse quick fixes and quick assist for Java

=== Using quick fixes and quick assists

The Eclipse IDE provides quick fixes and quick assists to efficiently solve common problems in your Java code.
For your Java code you can create  custom quick fixes and quick assistance via additional custom plug-ins.
Such plug-ins require the following plug-ins as dependency in their manifest.

* org.eclipse.jdt.ui
* org.eclipse.jdt.core
* org.eclipse.core.runtime
* org.eclipse.jface
* org.eclipse.jface.text


=== Quick assist processors

Quick Assists Processors provide the opportunity to provide context sensitive refactorings and assistance in an editor, e.g., the Java editor.

In order to provide quick assistance the _org.eclipse.jdt.ui.quickAssistProcessors_ extension point has to be used.

The referenced class in the extension point has to be an instance of `IQuickAssistProcessor`, which specifies the `boolean hasAssists(IInvocationContext context)` and `IJavaCompletionProposal[] getAssists(IInvocationContext context, IProblemLocation[] locations)` methods.

The `hasAssists` method specifies whether the quick assist is appropriate.

The `getAssists` method returns an array of `IJavaCompletionProposal` objects, which can apply refactorings and changes to the code.


=== Quick fix processors

The Eclipse Java Development Tools (JDT) allow the creation of custom quick fixes via the `org.eclipse.jdt.ui.quickFixProcessors` extension point from the `org.eclipse.jdt.ui` plug-in.

The class which is referred by the extension points must implement the `IQuickFixProcessor` interface.
This defines the `hasCorrections()` and `getCorrections()` methods.

The `IProblem` interface defines the possible problems.

=== Finding predefined problem ids

The `IProblem` interface contains a huge amount of potential problem ids, where a quick fix could be used to resolve a certain problem.

Due to the huge amount of problem ids it sometimes is pretty hard to figure out, which problem id is in charge for a particular problem.

Therefore an empty implementation of an `IQuickFixProcessor` can be used to find the correct id.

With the `IQuickFixProcessor` from above the Eclipse IDE can be started from the Eclipse IDE itself and a certain problem can be reconstructed, e.g., in a Java editor.

Once a problem appears and the `hasCorrections()` is invoked the actual problem id will be printed to the system output.
