== Quick Assist Processors

Quick Assists Processors provide the opportunity to provide context sensitive refactorings and assistance in an editor, e.g., the Java editor.

In order to provide quick assistance the _org.eclipse.jdt.ui.quickAssistProcessors_ extension point has to be used.

The referenced class in the extension point has to be an instance of `IQuickAssistProcessor`, which specifies the `boolean hasAssists(IInvocationContext context)` and `IJavaCompletionProposal[] getAssists(IInvocationContext context, IProblemLocation[] locations)` methods.

The `hasAssists` method specifies whether the quick assist is appropriate.

The `getAssists` method returns an array of `IJavaCompletionProposal` objects, which can apply refactorings and changes to the code.
