== Finding predefined problem ids

The `IProblem` interface contains a huge amount of potential problem ids, where a quick fix could be used to resolve a certain problem.

Due to the huge amount of problem ids it sometimes is pretty hard to figure out, which problem id is in charge for a particular problem.

Therefore an empty implementation of an `IQuickFixProcessor` can be used to find the correct id.

With the `IQuickFixProcessor` from above the Eclipse IDE can be started from the Eclipse IDE itself and a certain problem can be reconstructed, e.g., in a Java editor.

Once a problem appears and the `hasCorrections()` is invoked the actual problem id will be printed to the system output.
