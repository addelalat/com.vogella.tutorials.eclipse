Just stick to the defaults and press the btn:[Finish] button.

=== Provide IJavaCompletionProposals with an IQuickFixProcessor

The `IQuickFixProcessor` is pretty similar to an `IQuickAssistProcessor`, but just reacts on certain problems in an editor or in the problems view.

In <<find-problem-id>> a way how to find the right problem id for a certain problem is described.

Your task will be to grab a certain problem id and implement a Quick fix for that particular problem.
