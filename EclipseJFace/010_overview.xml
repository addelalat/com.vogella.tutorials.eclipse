	<title>What is Eclipse JFace?

	
		Eclipse
		_JFace_
		is a set of plug-ins based upon the user interface toolkit
		SWT. JFace
		provides classes
		and frameworks which
		simplify common
		SWT
		use cases.
		JFace
		does not hide the
		SWT
		API; therefore,
		SWT
		knowledge is still required.
	


	
		JFace
		provides the
		_viewers_
		framework,
		which simplifies the mapping of a data model to a visual
		representation.
		For
		example you find viewers for ComboBoxes, Tables and Trees.
	

	
		JFace
		also provides helper classes to effectively manage your
		system
		resources,
		like colors, images and fonts.
	
	
		In addition
		JFace
		provides support for handling
		preferences,
		preference pages, wizards and dialogs. It also contains functionality
		to support icon decorations and user-input help for SWT controls.

	

	
		_JFace Data Binding_
		is a framework which connects properties of
		objects. It is typically
		used to synchronize fields of the user
		interface
		with properties of
		model objects and allows you to include
		validation and conversion in
		this
		synchronization process.
