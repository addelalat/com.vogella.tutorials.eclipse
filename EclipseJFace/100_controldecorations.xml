		The
		`ControlDecoration`
		class allows you to place image decorations on SWT controls to show
		additional information about the control. These decorations can also
		have a description text which is displayed once the
		user places the
		mouse
		over them.
	
	
		During the layout of your screen you
		need to make sure
		that
		enough
		space is
		available to display these
		decorations.
	
	
		The following code snippet shows how to create
		`ControlDecoration`
