== User input help with field assistance
(((JFace,Field assistance)))
	
The
`org.eclipse.jface.fieldassist`
package provides
assistance to define user-input help for a
widget,
e.g., a
text field or
combo
box. The
`ContentProposalAdapter`
class is responsible for
providing the possible input values.
	
In the following example
the
content proposal should get
activated
via
certain keys ("." and
"#") as
well as the
kbd:[Ctrl+Space]
key combination.
	
The following code demonstrates the usage of the field assistance
functionality. It
also uses the
`ControlDecoration`
class.
	
[source,java]
----
include::res/fieldassists/MyView.java[]

If used the result should look similar to the following.
