		The
		<code>org.eclipse.jface.fieldassist</code>
		package provides
		assistance to define user-input help for a
		widget,
		e.g., a
		text field or
		combo
		box. The
		<code>ContentProposalAdapter</code>
		class is responsible for
		providing the possible input values.
	
	
		In the following example
		the
		content proposal should get
		activated
		via
		certain keys ("." and
		"#") as
		well as the
		<keycombo>
			<keycap>Ctrl</keycap>
			<keycap>Space</keycap>
		</keycombo>
		key combination.
	
	
		The following code demonstrates the usage of the field assistance
		functionality. It
		also uses the
		<code>ControlDecoration</code>
		class.
	
	
		<programlisting>
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
				parse="text" href="./examples/fieldassists/MyView.java" />
		</programlisting>
	
	 If used the result should look similar to the following.
