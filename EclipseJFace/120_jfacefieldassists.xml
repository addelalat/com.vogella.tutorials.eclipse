		The
		`org.eclipse.jface.fieldassist`
		package provides
		assistance to define user-input help for a
		widget,
		e.g., a
		text field or
		combo
		box. The
		`ContentProposalAdapter`
		class is responsible for
		providing the possible input values.
	
	
		In the following example
		the
		content proposal should get
		activated
		via
		certain keys ("." and
		"#") as
		well as the
		<keycombo>
			<keycap>Ctrl</keycap>
			<keycap>Space</keycap>
		</keycombo>
		key combination.
	
	
		The following code demonstrates the usage of the field assistance
		functionality. It
		also uses the
		`ControlDecoration`
		class.
