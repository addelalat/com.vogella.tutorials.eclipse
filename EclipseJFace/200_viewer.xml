== Eclipse JFace Viewers

		

(((JFace,Viewer)))
		
=== Purpose of the JFace viewer framework
		
			The
			JFace viewer
			framework
			allows you to display a domain model in
			a standard SWT widget
			like
			list,
			combo, tree or table
			without
			converting
			the domain
			model
			beforehand.
		
		
			A
			viewer
			allows you to set a
			_content provider_
			which provides the data for the
			viewer. The
			content provider
			makes no
			assumption about the presentation of the data model.
		
		
			You can also assign at least one
			_label provider_
			to a
			viewer. The label provider defines how the data from the model
			will be
			displayed in the
			viewer.
		

	

=== Standard JFace viewer
		
			JFace provides several standard
			viewer implementations. These
			viewers
			are part of the
			`org.eclipse.jface.viewers`
			package. The following
			list contains
			the most important ones.

|Interface
|Default implementation
|Description
						
					
					
						
|IStructuredContentProvider
|ArrayContentProvider
|
								Used for the List-, Combo- and TableViewer.
								JFace provides
								a
								default
								implementation for Collections and Arrays with the
								`ArrayContentProvider`
								class. Because the
								`ArrayContentProvider`
								class
								does not store any data, it is possible to share an
								instance
								with
								several viewers. To get a
								shared instance use the
								`ArrayContentProvider.getInstance()`
								method.
							
						
						
| ITreeContentProvider
|Not available
|Used for the TreeViewer class. Has additional
								methods
								to
								determine the
								children and the parents of the elements.
