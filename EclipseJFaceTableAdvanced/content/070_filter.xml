== Tutorial: Using a Filter
	
		The following adds a filter to the table based on the
		_Search_
		`Text`
		widget.
		The user can enter search pattern in this text field
		and
		data
		which fits to the entered pattern will be displayed.
	
	Create the following new class.
	
[source,java]
----
include::res/filter/PersonFilter.java[]
----
	
	
		Add to your search text field a `keyListener`
		which updates the filter
		and
		the
		viewer. You need also to define a new
		`private PersonFilter
			filter;
		`
		field and change the
		`createPartControl()`
		method.
	
	
[source,java]
----
include::res/filter/View.java[]
----
	
	Run the example, filtering should work.
