=== Using viewers to display a tree

			The
			`TreeViewer`
			class provides viewer support for displaying trees. The usage of this
			class is
			similar to the
			`TableViewer`
			class.
			The main difference
			is
			that the
			`TreeViewer`
			class
			requires a structured
			content provider.
			Typically your content
			provider has to implement the
			`ITreeContentProvider`
			interface to be used with your
			`TreeViewer`
			class.
		

		
			The usage of the
			`TreeViewer`
			class is demonstrated in
			<xref linkend="jfacefilebrowser" />
			.
		

	

=== Selection and double-click listener

		
			JFace allows you to access the SWT controls to define listeners on
			your viewer. For example you can
			add a
			`SelectionListener`
			implementation
			to the
			SWT
			control which is wrapped in the JFace object.
			The following code snippet
			demonstrates how to
			expand a tree
			with a
			mouse click.
		
		
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/swt/expand.java" />
			</programlisting>
		

		
			Viewers
			allows you to add certain listeners directly to them.
			The
			following
			example shows how to expand an instance of a
			`TreeViewer`
			with a
			double
			click.
		
		
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/swt/expanddouble.java" />
			</programlisting>

=== Adjusting tree columns TreeColumns on expand
		In case a `TreeViewer` has multiple columns it does not look good, if the first
			column, which contains the expandable items is clipped.

			</mediaobject>
		
		
		In order to let a column fit to it's contents width you can invoke the columns
				`pack` method like that.
		
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/swt/ExpandlistenerWithPack.java"/>
			</programlisting>
		
		With this code every column of the `Tree` will have the appropriate width,
			when an `TreeItem` is expaned, so that the contents of the column is not
			clipped.
