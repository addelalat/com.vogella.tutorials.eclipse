== Optional Exercise: File browser via a TreeViewer

=== Create a new application

This exercise is a stand-alone exercise and can be used to
repeat the steps of creating an Eclipse 4 application.

Use the
_Eclipse 4 wizard_
from
menu:File[New > Other... > Eclipse 4 > Eclipse 4 Application Project]
to create a new Eclipse 4 application without sample data called
_com.example.e4.filebrowser_.

The important selection in the last wizard page is highlighted
in the following screenshot.

=== Add an image file

Download or create an icon called folder.png and place it into
the
"icons" folder of your plug-in.

You find an example icon under the
following URL:
http://download.vogella.com/resources/folder.png[Folder icon].

This icon is taken from the following icon collection:
http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk/[FamFamFam icons].

=== Create a part

Add a part stack with a
part
to your application model and display a
`TreeViewer`
in this
part.

Implement a class for the
`ITreeContentProvider`
interface
which allows you to browse the file system. Review the
Javadoc
of
this class to understand the methods of this interface.

Also implement your custom
`LabelProvider`
for the tree.

Use
`viewer.setInput(File.listRoots());`
to set the initial input to the
viewer.

The following listing contains an example implementation for
this
exercise. It assumes that you added the "folder.png" icon to the
"icons" folder. It also demonstrates the usage of a
`ViewLabelProvider`.

[source,java]
----
include::res/filebrowser/FileBrowserPart.java[]
----

Link
from your part in the application model to your new class.

=== Validating

Start your new application ensure that you see the content of
your file system in your tree.
