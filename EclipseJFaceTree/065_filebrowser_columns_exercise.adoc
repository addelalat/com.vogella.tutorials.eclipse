== Optional exercise: Add multiple columns to a tree viewer

NOTE: This exercise assumes that <<jfacefilebrowser>> has been done, since this exercise is based on it.

=== Using TreeViewerColumns in the file browser

To add multiple columns in a
`TreeViewer`, the
`TreeViewerColumn`
class can be used to define columns for the underlying tree.

A
`TreeViewerColumn`
itself is a wrapper around the
`TreeColumn`
widget
from SWT.

----
include::res/treeColumn/TreeColumn.java[]
----

Instead of applying a
`CellLabelProvider`
for the whole viewer each
`TreeViewerColumn`
gets its own
`CellLabelProivder`
assigned. This allows that label for each column can
be defined separately. To
assign a label provider to the tree
viewer column
the
`TreeViewerColumn#setLabelProvider`
method is used.

=== Validating

Start your new application ensure that you see the content of
your file system in your tree.
