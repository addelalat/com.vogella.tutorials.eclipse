=== Using TreeViewerColumns in the file browser
		
			To add multiple columns in a
			`TreeViewer`
			, the
			`TreeViewerColumn`
			class can be used to define columns for the underlying tree.
		
		
			A
			`TreeViewerColumn`
			itself is a wrapper around the
			`TreeColumn`
			widget
			from SWT.
		
		
			<programlisting>
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/treeColumn/TreeColumn.java" />
			</programlisting>
		
		
			Instead of applying a
			`CellLabelProvider`
			for the whole viewer each
			`TreeViewerColumn`
			gets its own
			`CellLabelProivder`
			assigned. This allows that label for each column can
			be defined separately. To
			assign a label provider to the tree
			viewer column
			the
			`TreeViewerColumn#setLabelProvider`
			method is used.

=== Validating
