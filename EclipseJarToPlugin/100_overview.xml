	<title>JAR files without OSGi meta-data</title>
	<para>
		If a JAR file does not contain the OSGi meta-data in the
		<filename>META-INF/MANIFEST.MF</filename>
		file, it cannot be directly consumed by other Eclipse plug-ins.
	</para>
	<para>
		If you want to use such standard Java libraries in other Eclipse
		plug-ins you
		have to convert them also into a
		plug-in. After the
		conversion the resulting JAR file can still be used in a non OSGi
		runtime, e.g., a Java webserver.
		The Java runtime ignores
		the additional OSGi meta-data.
	</para>
	<para>
		Eclipse provides a wizard to convert a JAR file with OSGi meta-data to
		a plug-in. The usage of this
		wizard is
		demonstrated in
		<xref linkend="jartoplugin" />
		.
	</para>
	<note>
		<para>If you repackage a JAR into a plug-in it is wise to check if
			the
			license allows this. You should also try to
			contact the author of the
			software and ask if he can integrate the OSGi meta-data directly
			in his library.
