== Integrating external jars / third party libraries

The following gives an example how to convert a standard Java JAR to an Eclipse plug-in via the user interface.


=== Creating a plug-in project for your jar

Create a new plug-in project by selecting menu:File[New > Project > Plug-in Development > Plug-in from Existing JAR Archives].

Add the JAR files you want to have in this new plug-in. Press next.

Enter a name and a version for your new plug-in. 
Uncheck the _Unzip the JAR archive into the project_ flag. 
Unchecking this flag prevents that the class files are extracted from the JAR file which is not necessary to use them.

Afterwards press the _Finish_ button in the wizard.

You have created a new plug-in for the selected JAR files. 
Open the _MANIFEST.MF_ file and validate that all required packages are exported on the _Runtime_ tab. 
All the packages from your JAR files should be included in the exported packages.
Otherwise OSGi prevents other plug-ins from accessing them.



=== Using the new plug-in project

In the plug-in project which should access the library, open the _MANIFEST.MF_ file and select the _Dependencies_ tab. 
Add the new plug-in as dependency.
