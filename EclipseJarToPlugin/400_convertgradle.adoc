== Convert JAR files to OSGi bundles with Gradle
	
You can also use the Gradle build system to convert JARs to OSGi bundles.
For example, the following build.gradle file converts the EasyMock library and its dependencies to OSGi bundles. 
Under the hood, it uses the bnd tooling.
	
[source,gradle]
----
include::res/gradle/build.gradle[]
----
	
Run `gradle bundles` to create OSGi bundles from the specified JAR files.
Use the `gradle updateSite` task to create a p2 update site.
