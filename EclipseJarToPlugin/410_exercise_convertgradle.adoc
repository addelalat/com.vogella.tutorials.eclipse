== Exercise - Convert JAR files to OSGi bundles with Gradle

[[convert_osgi_gradle_target]]
=== Target

In this exercise a p2 update site for the retrofit library, including its' Gson converter, will be created.

Retrofit is a library for making REST calls fairly easy, including the serialization etc.

=== Installing Gradle

For this exercise the Gradle build tool is required.

How to install Gradle can be found here: http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/Gradle/article.html#installing-and-configuring-gradle[Gradle tutorial]


=== The build.gradle file

Create a folder called _retrofit-osgi_ on your maschine. In this folder a _build.gradle_ file has to be created.

[source, console]
----
mkdir retrofit-osgi
touch build.gradle
----

The _build.gradle_ file should have the following contents:

[source, groovy]
----
include::res/gradle/build.gradle[]
----

Go to the *retrofit-osgi* folder and run the *updateSite* task.

[source, console]
----
cd retrofit-osgi

gradle uS
----
