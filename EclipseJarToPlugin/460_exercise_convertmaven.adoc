[[convert_osgi_p2_maven_target]]
=== Target

In this exercise a p2 update site for the RxJava 2.0 library will be created.

RxJava is a library for reactive programming in Java. See http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/RxJava/article.html[RxJava tutorial] for more information on RxJava.

=== Creating a p2 maven project

Create a folder called _p2-maven_ on your maschine. In this folder a _pom.xml_ file has to be created.

[source, console]
----
mkdir p2-maven
touch pom.xml
----

Alternatively a new general project in the Eclipse workspace called _p2-maven_ could be created, which contains a _pom.xml_ file.

The _pom.xml_ file should have the following contents:

[source, xml]
----
include::res/p2-maven-plugin/pom-rxjava.xml[]
----

Go to the *p2-maven* folder and run the *p2:site* goal.

[source, console]
----
cd p2-maven

maven clean p2:site
----

[[convert_osgi_p2_maven_validate]]
=== Validate

Try to use the update site in your running Eclipse IDE, but do *not* install it.
