== Using syncExec() and asyncExec()
	
In Eclipse 3.x API based plug-ins you cannot use dependency injection
to get the
`UISynchronize`
instance injected.
	
In this case you can use the
`Display`
class which provides the 
`syncExec()`
and
`asyncExec()`
methods to update the user interface from another
thread.
