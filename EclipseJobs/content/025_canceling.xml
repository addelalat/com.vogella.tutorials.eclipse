	<title>Handle Job cancellation</title>
	<para>
		In Eclipse many user complain about jobs, which are not properly
		canceled when pressing the red square cancel button in the progess
		view. Some
		<code>Job</code>
		implementations simply just don't care and do not react on the
		cancellation, which is triggered by the user.
	</para>
	<para>
		This of course concludes in a really poor user experience, which
		should definitely be avoided.
	</para>
	<para>
		In order to realize that a user has canceled a Job the
		<code>IProgressMonitor</code>
		, which is passed to the
		<code>run</code>
		method of a Job, can be asked whether the Job has been canceled. This
		can be done by calling the
		<code>isCanceled</code>
		on an
		<code>IProgressMonitor</code>
		.
	</para>
	<para>This check for cancellation should be done in a frequent manner,
		so that the user does not have to wait too long until the job will
		really be canceled.

		<para>
			The new
			<code>split</code>
			method can handle the cancellation check automatically and throws an
			<code>OperationCanceledException</code>
			in case the
			<code>IProgressMonitor</code>
			has been canceled. The
			<code>OperationCanceledException</code>
			is automatically caught by a
			<code>Job</code>
			, which will just set the
			<code>Status.CANCEL_STATUS</code>
			then.
		</para>
		<para>
			<note>
				Using the new Submonitor's
				<code>split</code>
				is not only shorter than the former approach, but also provides
				better performance since the expensive
				<code>isCanceled</code>
				call is only done in case it is really necessary.
