== Tutorial: Using Eclipse Jobs
	
		Create a new Eclipse plug-in project "de.vogella.jobs.first" with a
		`View`
		and a
		`Button`
		included in this
		`View`
		.
	

	
		Create the following
		`MySelectionAdapter`
		class.
	

	
[source,java]
----
include::res/first/MySelectionAdapter.java[]
----
	

	



		Add an instance of
		`MySelectionAdapter`
		as
		`SelectionListener`
		to your
		`Button`
		.
	

	
[source,text]
----
include::res/first/button.java[]
----
	
	
		To access the
		`Shell`
		in Eclipse 3.x you can use the
		`getSite().getShell()`
		method call. In Eclipse 4  you declare a field and let Eclipse inject
		the
		`Shell`
		.
	
	
[source,java]
----
include::res/first/injectshell.txt[]
----
	

	
		Start your application or the Eclipse workbench with your plug-in and
		press the
		`Button`
		.
		A dialog is opened.
