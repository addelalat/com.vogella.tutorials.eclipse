== Eclipse Launching Framework

	
		The Eclipse IDE supports launching of other programs. Launching in this context is
		defined as running or
		debugging
		a
		program from
		within the Eclipse IDE. A
		_launcher_
		is a
		set of
		Java
		classes in an Eclipse plug-in that
		performs
		launching.
	
	
		The framework allows defining launch configuration types which defines how launch configuration 
		are created.
	
	
		The
		`org.eclipse.debug.core`
		plug-in is responsible for of creating and persisting launch configurations on behalf of the configuration
		type and
		`org.eclipse.debug.ui`
		provides the base functionality to display and change an existing launch configuration.
