	<title>Launch configuration in general
	The easiest way to create a launch configuration is using the _Run
			Configuration..._ dialog.
	This dialog can be accessed in several ways.
	
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				By typing menu:
						<guimenu>Run Configurations...</guimenu>
					</menuchoice> in the Quick Access
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				By holding <keycode>Ctrl</keycode> while pressing the green launch button.
						<inlinegraphic fileref="images/run_exc.png"/>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				By using the drop down menu of the green launch button <inlinegraphic
						fileref="images/run_exc.png"/> and clicking on  menu:
						<guimenu>Run Configurations...</guimenu>
					</menuchoice> in the menu.
			</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
	
	In the _Run Configuration..._ you can choose between different launch
		configuration types:
	
		<mediaobject>

				<imagedata fileref="images/run_configurations.png"/>
			</imageobject>
		</mediaobject>
	
	How to create new launch configurations is described within the picture above.
	<section>
=== Export a launch configuration
		Those launch configurations can also be exported to a <filename>*.launch</filename>
			file.
		You can reach the export wizard via export command in the file menu or by typing
				_Export (Launch Configuration)_ in the Quick Access.
		
image::export_launch_configuration.png"/>
				</imageobject>
			</mediaobject>
		
		When pressing <guibutton>Next</guibutton> you can choose, which launch configuration you
			want to export and define a location to store the <filename>*.launch</filename>
			file.
		
image::launch_configuration_export_wizard.png"/>
				</imageobject>
			</mediaobject>
		
		The exported <filename>Eclipse Application Launch Configuration.launch</filename> file
			looks like this:
		
			<programlisting language="xml">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/Eclipse_Application_Launch_Configuration.launch"/>
			</programlisting>
		
		As you can see your launch configuration is stored in a XML format, which contains the
			specific settings of your custom launch configuration.
	
	<section>
=== Import a launch configuration
		The exported launch configuration can of cause be imported as well.
		You can reach the import wizard via import command in the file menu or by typing
				_Import (Launch Configuration)_ in the Quick Access.
		
image::import_launch_configuration.png"/>
				</imageobject>
			</mediaobject>
		
		When pressing <guibutton>Next</guibutton> you can look for a
				<filename>*.launch</filename> file in your file system, and import it.
		
image::launch_configuration_import_wizard.png"/>
				</imageobject>
			</mediaobject>
		
		After we successfully imported a certain <filename>*.launch</filename> file, we can
			choose and run this launch configuration with the _Run
				Configuration..._ dialog.
