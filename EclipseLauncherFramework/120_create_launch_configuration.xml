		The exported _Eclipse Application Launch Configuration.launch_ file
			looks like this:
		
[source,xml]
----
include::res/Eclipse_Application_Launch_Configuration.launch"/>
			</programlisting>
		
		As you can see your launch configuration is stored in a XML format, which contains the
			specific settings of your custom launch configuration.

=== Import a launch configuration
		The exported launch configuration can of cause be imported as well.

				_Import (Launch Configuration)_ in the Quick Access.

			choose and run this launch configuration with the _Run
				Configuration..._ dialog.
