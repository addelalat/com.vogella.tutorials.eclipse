== Exercise - Creating a JPA service implementation

=== Target

Provide a service implementation of the previously created `TodoService`, which makes use of Eclipse Link, a H2 Database Engine and JPA.

=== Creating the service bundle

Create a plugin project called _com.vogella.jpa.service_ with the following bundle dependencies:

* javax.persistence
* org.eclipse.persistence.jpa
* org.h2

and package imports

* com.vogella.jpa.model
* org.osgi.service.component.annotations (as optional dependency)

[NOTE]
====
Please activate the _Generate descriptors from annotated sources_ preference, so that the component xml file will be created automatically for the `TodoServiceImpl`.

====

The `TodoServiceImpl`, which impelements the `TodoService` interface should look like this:

[source, java]
----
include::res/TodoServiceImpl.java[]
----

The _osgi.command.scope_ and _osgi.command.function_ properties in the `@Component` definition allows to call certain methods, e.g., the `printTodos` method, from the command line by using the felix gogo shell.


The `@Activate` and `@Deactivate` annotations ensure that the `activateComponent` and `deactivateComponent` methods will be called once the service is activated or deactivated.

In order to persist Todo objects in the H2 database certain properties for the so called _persistence-unit_ have to be specified in a _persistence.xml_ file, which is supposed to be located in the _META-INF_ folder of the projects right besides the _MANIFEST.MF_ file.

The contents of the _persistence.xml_ should look like this:

[source, xml]
----
include::res/persistence.xml[]
----


[IMPORTANT]
====
Make sure that all the files like _persistence.xml_ and the _com.vogella.jpa.service.TodoServiceImpl.xml_ are also mentioned in the build.properties file.
====

=== Validate

Go to the _Debug Configurations_ and create a new _OSGi Framework_ configuration.

Simply select the _com.vogella.jpa.model_ and _com.vogella.jpa.service_ bundles from the workspace and hit the btn:[Add Required Bundles] button.

When running the new _OSGi Framework_ configuration the OSGi console should appear in the _Console_ view, where you can type the following:

[source, console]
----
osgi> test:printTodos
----

The console should show the following output:

[NOTE]
====
The *test:printTodos* command is related to the properties in the `@Component` annotation in the `TodoServiceImpl` class.
