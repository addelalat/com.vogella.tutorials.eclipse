== Exercise - Using the JPA service as standalone application

In the <<exercise_jpa_service_impl>> chapter an _OSGi Framework_ configuration has been used to start the OSGi runtime together with the JPA service from the IDE.
In this exercise the OSGi runtime will be started outside the Eclipse IDE.

See http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/OSGi/article.html#running-a-stand-alone-osgi-server[OSGi Tutorial] for further information.

=== Creating a product with proper configuration

Usually products are used to create rich client applications, but for the sake of generating the predefined structure and aggregation of necessary bundles a slightly tweaked product can be used.

Create a general project called _com.vogella.jpa.product_ and create a _Product Configuration_ called _com.vogella.jpa.product_.

Switch to the contents tab and add the following bundles to it:

* com.vogella.jpa.model
* com.vogella.jpa.service
* org.eclipse.equinox.console
* org.apache.felix.gogo.command
* org.apache.felix.gogo.runtime
* org.apache.felix.gogo.shell
* org.eclipse.equinox.simpleconfigurator
* org.eclipse.equinox.ds

After that press the btn:[Add Required Plug-ins] button to add all necessary dependencies.

Create a _config.ini_ file with the following contents in the root folder besides the _com.vogella.jpa.product_ file:

[source, config]
----
osgi.bundles=reference\:file\:plugins/org.eclipse.equinox.simpleconfigurator_1.1.200.v20160504-1450.jar@1\:start
org.eclipse.equinox.simpleconfigurator.configUrl=file\:org.eclipse.equinox.simpleconfigurator/bundles.info
osgi.bundles.defaultStartLevel=4
osgi.noShutdown=true
eclipse.ignoreApp=true
----

On the _Configuration_ tab of the product this config.ini file can be referenced.

Now the product can be exported.

image::product-export.png[] 

A proper _Destination_ has to be chosen and _Generate p2 repository_ is not necessary and _Syncronize before exporting_ won't work because there is no product specifying bundle.

As final step before the exported product can be started the _org.eclipse.osgi_ bundle, e.g., org.eclipse.osgi_3.11.2.v20161107-1947.jar, has to be copied into the root folder of the exported product.


[CAUTION]
====
Currently custom _config.ini_ files are not considered by the product export.
See https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=284732[Bug 284732].
So please ensure that the exported product's _config.ini_ file looks like specified above.

=== Validate

After making all these changes the folder structure of the exported product should look similar to this: 

image::product-export-folder-structure.png[] 

Now the application can be run from the command line by starting it like this:

[source, console]
----
java -jar org.eclipse.osgi_3.11.2.v20161107-1947.jar -console
----

After executing this the OSGi console should appear.

In order to check whether the JPA service is properly working the `test:printTodos` command can be invoked again.
