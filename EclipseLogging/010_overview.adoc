== Eclipse Logging
	
The
`org.eclipse.e4.core.services`
plug-in contains the
`Logger`
class which can get injected via dependency injection. The default
implementation is provided by the
`WorkbenchLogger`
class.

The
`Logger`
implementation wraps the
`IStatus`
into an simpler interface and provides several methods to log info,
warning or error message. The following code shows example calls.

Customers can replace the
`WorkbenchLogger`
implementation in the Context with there own implementation. For
example this way customers could log to the Eclipse system as well as
to other external log systems.

The log level can be setup in the
_config.ini_
file of your application via the
_eclipse.log.level_
parameter. The value can be set to
_INFO_,
_WARNING_
and
_ERROR_.
_INFO_
will for example show all log message.
	
By default Eclipse logs all messages.
