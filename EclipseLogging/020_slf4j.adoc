== SLF4J in eclipse applications

Many Java developers are more familiar with the http://www.slf4j.org/[SLF4J logging facade], which is more powerful than Eclipse's default logger.

=== Obtaining the SLF4J library from Orbit

The http://www.eclipse.org/orbit/[Eclipse Orbit Project] provides many different open source libraries, which can be obtained as OSGi bundles from Obrit's p2 update sites.
This makes it easy to use third party open source libraries for target definitions and a Maven Tycho build.

One of the most popular slf4j implementations is the http://logback.qos.ch/[Logback logger], which is also available on Orbit's p2 update site.

[CAUTION]
====
The Orbit p2 update sites URLs change quite regularly.
Therefore it is recommended to look in the http://download.eclipse.org/tools/orbit/downloads/[Orbit downloads section] to find the right p2 update site URL.

=== Using SLF4J

The SLF4J dependencies just have to be added to the desired bundle.

After doing this the SLF4J logger API can be used in the classes of the bundle.

[source, java]
----
private static final Logger LOG = LoggerFactory.getLogger(ClassWithInfosToBeLogged.class);
----

TIP: It saves a lot of effort, when a Template for the creation of this `LOG` instance is created.

=== Configuring Logback

Usually Logback is configured by a _logback.xml_ or _logback-test.xml_ file. (see http://logback.qos.ch/manual/configuration.html[Logback configuration manual])

In an OSGi environment it is not that easy for Logback to automatically determine where the _logback.xml_ logger configuration is stored.

For Logback the `ch.qos.logback.classic.joran.JoranConfigurator` is used to parse the _logback.xml_ configuration file.

By obtaining the `ch.qos.logback.classic.LoggerContext` and using the `JoranConfigurator` the location of the _logback.xml_ file can be set programmatically.

In some cases it is pretty handy to have this _logback.xml_ logger configuration in the _configuration_ folder of the RCP application rather than bundled in a JAR file.
So _logback.xml_ logger configuration can easily be changed in a production environment if necessary.

How to provide external static files like a _logback.xml_ file for a product build with Maven Tycho can be found here: http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseTycho/article.html#exercise-tycho-build-for-products-with-root-files[Eclipse Tycho Tutorial]

The _LOG_DIR_ property, which is overridden in the code above, can be obtained like this:
