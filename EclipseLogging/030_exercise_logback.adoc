== Exercise - SLF4J and Logback in Eclipse applications

=== Target

Make use of http://www.slf4j.org/[SLF4J] and http://logback.qos.ch/[Logback] in an RCP application.

=== Obtaining the SLF4J and Logback library from Orbit

Install SLF4J and Logback into your IDE and reuse the IDE's target platform or create a target definition file and add all necessary features, like eclipse SDK and logger libs, to it.

See <<slf4j-logback-from-orbit>> for the SLF4J and Logback dependencies.

=== Create a plugin using SLF4J

Create a _com.vogella.logging.rcp_ plug-in project, which uses the E4 Application template.

Add the SLF4J dependencies:

Use a `Logger` in the generated `AboutHandler` class and log some debug messages or throw some `Exceptions`, which are logged.

[source, java]
----
include::res/AboutHandler.java[]
----

TIP: It saves a lot of effort, when a Template for the creation of this `LOG` instance is created.

=== Creating a plug-in that configures Logback

Create a _com.vogella.logging.config_ plug-in project with an Activator.

The root folder of this plug-in should contain the following _logback.xml_ file:

[source, xml]
----
include::res/exercise-logback.xml[] 
----

The following dependencies are required to configure Logback.

[NOTE]
====
Also using _Imported Packages_ for the Logback dependencies would be preferable, but unfortunately Logback has so many packages that they won't fit on the screenshot.
====

The `Activator` is supposed to initialize the Logback configuration.

[source, java]
----
include::res/ActivatorInBundleLogbackConfigSimple.java[]
----

=== Startup the logging config bundle

The configuration of the SLF4J implementation (Logback) should be seperated from the other bundles.
So that no dependency to the _com.vogella.logging.config_ bundle is necessary and other bundles just need to import the org.slf4j package, like it is done _com.vogella.logging.rcp_.

Due to that the _com.vogella.logging.config_ bundle will not be started automatically.
Therefore it must be added to the _Start Levels_ in the product configuration.

=== Validate

Start the sample RCP application and see whether the logging looks like expected according to your _logback.xml_ configuration.
