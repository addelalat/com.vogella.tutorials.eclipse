== Eclipse Logging
	
		The
		`org.eclipse.e4.core.services`
		plug-in contains the
		`Logger`
		class which can get injected via dependency injection. The default
		implementation is provided by the
		`WorkbenchLogger`
		class.
	
	
		<programlisting language="java">
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
				parse="text" href="../examples/getLogger.java" />
		</programlisting>
	


	
		The
		`Logger`
		implementation wraps the
		`IStatus`
		into an simpler interface and provides several methods to log info,
		warning or error message. The following code shows example calls.
	
	
		<programlisting language="java">
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
				parse="text" href="../examples/log.java" />
		</programlisting>
	

	
		Customers can replace the
		`WorkbenchLogger`
		implementation in the Context with there own implementation. For
		example this way customers could log to the Eclipse system as well as
		to other external log systems.
	
	
		The log level can be setup in the
		_config.ini_
		file of your application via the
		_eclipse.log.level_
		parameter. The value can be set to
		_INFO_
		,
		_WARNING_
		and
		_ERROR_
		.
		_INFO_
		will for example show all log message.
	
	By default Eclipse logs all messages.
