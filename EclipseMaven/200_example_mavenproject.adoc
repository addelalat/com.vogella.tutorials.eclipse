On the first wizard page you can select if you want to create a simple project. 
In this case you skip the archetype selection. 
In this exercise we want to use an archetype as template for our project creation.

Press next, filter for the "quickstart" archetype and select the `maven-archetype-quickstart` entry.
This is the classical Maven example archetype for project creation.

=== Adding dependencies to your project
		
The Eclipse Maven tooling makes adding dependencies to the classpath of your project simple. 
In can directly add it to your pom file, or use the _Dependencies_ tab of the pom editor.
		
Switch to the _Dependencies_ tab and press the _Add_ button.

In this example we add Gson as dependency. 
For this we use the GAV which we found via the http://search.maven.org website.
If the Maven index was downloaded (See <<maven_eclipseinstallation_index>> you can also search directly this dependency via the dialog.

=== Use library
		
Change or create the `App.java` class in your `src/main/java` folder. 
This classes uses Gson. 
As Maven added it to your classpath, it should compile and you should be able to start the class via Eclipse.
