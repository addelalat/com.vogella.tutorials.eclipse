== Exercise: Add Maven support to a Java project in Eclipse

=== Target of this exercise
This exercise demonstrates how to convert a Java project to a Maven project.

=== Create Java project
		
Create a new Java project called _com.vogella.build.maven.simple_ in Eclipse.
		
		
Add one class called `Main`. 
This class should have a `main` method, which write "Hello Maven!" to the command line.

[source,java]
----
include::res/first/Main.java[]
----
		
=== Convert to Maven project
		
Select your project, right-click on it and select menu:Configure[Convert to Maven project...].

This creates a _pom.xml_  file similar to the following.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/simple/pom.xml[]
----	
		
=== Execute the Maven build
		
Right-click the _pom.xml_ file and select menu:Run As[Maven build].

Enter "clean install" as Goal.

NOTE: You have to enter the goals manually. The _Select..._ button does not work, the dialog it displays is always empty.
			
		
Press the btn:[Finish] button.
This starts the build, which you can follow in the _Console_ view. 
		
Once the build finishes, press F5 on the project to refresh it.
You see a _target_ folder, which contains the build artifacts, e.g., a JAR file.
