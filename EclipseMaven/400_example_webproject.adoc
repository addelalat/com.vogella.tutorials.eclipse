[TIP]
====
You may see the error: _The superclass "javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet" was not found on the Java Build Path_. 
To fix this, right click on your project and select _Properties_. 
On the _Targeted Runtimes_ select your web server entry, e.g., Tomcat.
====


=== Build your project
		
Similar to <<example_eclipsemavenproject_runningthebuild>> run your `mvn clean verify` build command from Eclipse.
Validate that there are no issues with the build.


=== Run on the server
		
Right-click your project and select the menu:Run As[Run on Server] menu entry.
