== Analyzing Android heap dumps with Eclipse
	
Android allows to create heap dumps of an application's heap.
This heap dump is stored in a binary format called HPROF.
To create a heap dump use the _Dump HPROF file_ button in the _DDMS_ _Perspective_.
	
The Android heap dump format is similar to the Java heap dump format but not exactly the same.
Eclipse MAT can work directly with the Android heap dump format.
