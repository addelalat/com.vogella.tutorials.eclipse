== Creating heap dumps for Java programs

It is possible to instruct the JVM to create automatically a _heap dump_ in case that it runs out of memory, i.e. in case of a `OutOfMemoryError` error. 
To instruct the JVM to create a _heap dump_ in such a situation, start your Java application with the _-XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError_ option.

Use the menu:File[New > Other...> Other> Heap Dump] menu entry to open a dialog to select for which process you want to acquire a memory dump.

Select the process for a heap dump in the following dialog and press the btn:[Finish] button.
    

Alternatively you can also interactively create a heap dump via Eclipse. 
For this, open the _Memory Analysis_ perspective via menu:Perspective[Open Perspective > Other...].

If you trigger the creation of the heap manually the JVM performs sa garbage collector run before it writes the heap dump.
