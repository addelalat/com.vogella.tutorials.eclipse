== Use the Eclipse Memory Analyzer

=== Reviewing a heap dump

After a new _heap dump_ with the _.hprof_ ending has been created, you can open it via a double-click in Eclipse.
If you used MAT to create the heap dump, it should be opened automatically.

You may need to refresh your project (F5 on the project).
Double-click the file and select the _Leak Suspects Report_.

The overview page allows you to start the analysis of the heap dump.
The _dominator tree_ gives quickly an overview of the used objects.

In the dominator tree you see the references which are hold.

To find which element is holding the reference to this object, select the entry and select _Find shortest path to GC root_ from the context menu.


=== Analyzing Android heap dumps with Eclipse
    
Android allows to create heap dumps of an application's heap.
This heap dump is stored in a binary format called HPROF.
To create a heap dump use the btn:[Dump HPROF file] button in the _DDMS_ _Perspective_.
    
The Android heap dump format is similar to the Java heap dump format but not exactly the same.
Eclipse MAT can work directly with the Android heap dump format.
