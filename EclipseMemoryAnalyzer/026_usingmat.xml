== Use the Eclipse Memory Analyzer
	
		After a new
		_heap dump_
		with the
		_.hprof_
		ending has
		been created, you can open it via a double-click in
		Eclipse.
		If you used MAT to create the heap dump, it
		should be opened
		automatically.
	
	
		You may need
		to
		refresh your
		project (F5 on the project).
		Double-click
		the
		file
		and
		select the
		_Leak Suspects Report_
		.

		The overview page allows you to start the analysis of the heap
		dump.
		The
		_dominator tree_
		gives quickly an overview of the
		used objects.
