Eclipse Microsoft Integration.
This article will demonstrate how Eclipse SWT can be used to
integrate / use Microsoft applications. Eclipse is using the SWT GUI
framework. SWT does allow to integrated Microsoft application via
OLE (Object Linking and Embedding).Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft
Excel and the File explorer are used as examples. The examples used
are based on Eclipse RCP as this makes it easy to demonstrate the
usage but work also with stand-alone Java application (which are
using SWT).
This article assumes that you are already familiar with using
the Eclipse IDE and with developing simple Eclipse RCP applications.
