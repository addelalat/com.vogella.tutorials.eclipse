	=== Eclipse Microsoft Integration
			 This article will demonstrate how Eclipse SWT can be used to
				integrate / use Microsoft applications. Eclipse is using the SWT GUI
				framework. SWT does allow to integrated Microsoft application via
				OLE (Object Linking and Embedding).Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft
				Excel and the File explorer are used as examples. The examples used
				are based on Eclipse RCP as this makes it easy to demonstrate the
				usage but work also with stand-alone Java application (which are
				using SWT).
			 This article assumes that you are already familiar with using
				the Eclipse IDE and with developing simple Eclipse RCP applications.
