The Eclipse platform provides an installation and update mechanism called _Eclipse p2_ (short: p2).
This update mechanism allows you to update Eclipse applications and to install new functions.
		
The update and installation of functions with p2 is typical based on _feature projects_ (short: _features_). 
It is possible to update complete products or individual features.
In the terminology of p2 these features are _installable units_.
		

=== Creating p2 update sites
		
Installable units can be grouped into a p2 repository. 
A repository is defined via its URI and can point to a local file system or to a web server.
A p2 repository is also called _update site_.
		
During the export of an Eclipse application you can select the _Generate p2 repository_ option in the Eclipse product export dialog.
This option is highlighted in the following screenshot.

If you select this option, an update site iscreated in a sub-folder called _repository_ of the export directory.
		
Typically this directory is copied to a web server so users can install new functionality or upgrades using the p2 mechanism.

The Eclipse update mechanism also supports file based update sites. 
File based update sites are useful for testing the update functionality.
		
An update site contains an artifact and a metadata repository.
