== Patching existing Eclipse plug-ins with feature patches

=== Feature patch projects
(((Feature patch projects)))
If you want to modify standard Eclipse plug-ins, you can use _Feature Patch Projects_.
A Feature Patch Project	can contain plug-ins which replace existing plug-ins. 
This would allow you to create an update site for this feature and users can use your version of the modified code.

Each feature can only be patched once.

=== Feature patch projects

A feature patch project can get created via menu:File[New > Other... > Plug-in Development > Feature Patch].

In this dialog select the feature which you want to patch. 
Add every modified plug-in to your new project and export it as a p2 update site to make it available.
