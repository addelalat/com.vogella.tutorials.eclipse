		<para>
			As the Eclipse project is an open source project, it is possible
			to get the source code, modify it and provide
			the change back to the
			project. Most Eclipse projects use a code review process based on the
			Gerrit code review system.
			Some Eclipse projects also use Github for code contributions.
		</para>
		<para>
			Contributing to an Eclipse project has the benefit of getting
			feedback directly from the core developers. It also
			allows developers
			and organizations to fix bugs which affect them and to drive the
			project into a desired direction.
		</para>
		<para>While there are other ways of contributing to an Eclipse project, e.g., via updating the project documentation,
			this $book focuses on the process of contributing code to an Eclipse project.

		<para>
			Eclipse has a description for its user interface guidelines. These
			can be found under the following url:
			<ulink url="https://wiki.eclipse.org/User_Interface_Guidelines">Wiki about UI guidelines</ulink>
			.
		</para>
		<para>
			It is not expected that you read this guide completely, but in
			case you
			want
			to check what the Eclipse way of doing
			things is, you can
			have a
			look
			at this (old but still valid) description.
