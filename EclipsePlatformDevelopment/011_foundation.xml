			The Eclipse projects are governed by the
			<wordasword>Eclipse Foundation</wordasword>
			.
			The
			Eclipse Foundation
			is a non-profit, member supported
			corporation
			that
			hosts the Eclipse
			Open
			Source
			projects and helps
			to cultivate both
			its open source
			community and
			its
			ecosystem of complementary products
			and
			services.
		</para>
		<para>
			The Eclipse Foundation does not work on the Eclipse code base,
			i.e.,
			it does not have employee developers working on
			Eclipse.
			The mission
			of the
			Eclipse Foundation is to
			<emphasis>enable</emphasis>
			the development by
			providing
			the infrastructure
			(Git, Gerrit, Hudson
			build
			server, the download sites, etc.) and a
			structured process. Eclipse projects follow a very well defined development process. To learn more about this process see the
			eclipse.org website under the
			<ulink url="http://www.eclipse.org/projects/dev_process/development_process.php">Eclipse Development Process Online link
			</ulink>
			.

		<para>
			The
			<wordasword>Eclipse Public License</wordasword>
			(EPL) is an open source software license used
			by the
			Eclipse Foundation
			for its software. The EPL is designed to be
			business-friendly. EPL
			licensed programs can be used, modified, copied
			and distributed free
			of
			charge. The consumer of EPL-licensed software
			can choose to use this
			software in closed source programs.
		</para>
		<para>Only
			modifications in the original
			EPL code must also be
			released
			as EPL code. This can for example be done by filling a bug report at
			the public Eclipse bug tracker and by uploading a Gerrit change.
		</para>

		<para>
			The
			Eclipse Foundation
			validates that source code contributed
			to
			Eclipse projects is
			free
			of intellectual property (IP) issues. This
			process is known as IP
			cleansing. Contributions with more than 1000
			lines of code require the
			creation of
			a Contribution Questionnaire,
			and
			a review and approval
			by the IP
			team.
		</para>

		<para>
			The permissive EPL and the IP cleansing effort of the
			Eclipse
			Foundation
			makes reusing the source code of Eclipse projects
			attractive
			to companies.
