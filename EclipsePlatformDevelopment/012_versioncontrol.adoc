== Finding information about an Eclipse project

=== The Eclipse project page
		

Eclipse lists all project repositories under their project page. 
This page can be found via the main https://projects.eclipse.org[Eclipse projects page].
        
		
Use the project page you can search for an Eclipse project.
The individual project page includes information about future developments plans, documentation, wiki pages, developer mailing lists and the project charter.
If you click on the _Learn more_ in one of the search results you are taken to the project homepage. 
Click on the _Developer resources_ tab to see all Git repositories of the project.
		
The following screenshot depicts the website for the https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/eclipse.jdt.ui[JDT UI project].

=== The Eclipse dashboard
		
		
The Eclipse foundation provides also http://dashboard.eclipse.org[Dashboards].
		
		
For example http://dashboard.eclipse.org/its-contributors.html gives an overview of Eclipse contributions. 
The dashboard allows you to drill down as depicted in the following screenshot.
		
NOTE: The URL and appearance may still change over time. See https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=405792[Bug 405792] for details.
