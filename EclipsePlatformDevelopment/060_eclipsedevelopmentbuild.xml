		This is sometimes necessary to test the latest features or to
			test a build which is later promoted to M or RC
			build by the Eclipse
			platform team.
		
		NOTE:
			
				For several Eclipse projects you can also use the Eclipse installer. See
				<xref linkend="usingtheinstaller" />
				for a small description. At the time of this writing the installer does not work well for platform contributions
				hence is not the preferred way for contributing to it.
			
		</note>

	

=== Install the Git tooling into the Eclipse IDE
		After you downloaded a recent build for the Eclipse IDE, you need to install a few more plug-ins, most notable
			the Eclipse Git tooling.
