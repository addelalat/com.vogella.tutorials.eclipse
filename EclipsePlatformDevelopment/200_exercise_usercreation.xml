		<title>Create an Eclipse user account</title>

		<para>
			To contribute to an Eclipse project you need to have valid user credentials. If you already have an Eclipse Bugzilla
			or Eclipse
			Forum
			account, you have already done this step. These systems use the same
			account.

			You can create a new user
			via the
			following:
			<ulink url="https://dev.eclipse.org/site_login/createaccount.php">
				Create Eclipse.org user account
			</ulink>
			.
		</para>

	<section id="eclipsecontribution_usersetup_cla">
		<title>Sign the Contributor License Agreement (CLA)</title>
		<para>You also need to confirm to the Eclipse foundation that you have the right to contribute your code to
			the Eclipse
			open source project. This requires that you sign a
			contributor
			license
			agreement (CLA) via a web interface. Signing is
			really simple and only takes a few minutes.
		</para>

		<para>
			The Eclipse CLA
			FAQ describes the process and purpose of the CLA. At
			the end this
			document contains
			a
			link
			for signing the
			CLA. You find it
			under the
			following URL:
			<ulink url="http://www.eclipse.org/legal/clafaq.php">Eclipse CLA FAQ</ulink>
			.
		</para>
		<tip>
			<para> In case
				you contribute to the Eclipse open source project
				during your work time, ensure that your employer
				agrees that the
				code can
				be contributed.

		<title>Configure your Eclipse Gerrit user</title>
		<para>
			You need to configure Gerrit if you want to use SSH or HTTPS to upload your contributions. The Gerrit user is
			NOT the same as your Eclipse user. Also, the
			Gerrit HTTPS password is NOT
			the same as your
			Eclipse user password.
		</para>
		<para>
			To configure your access
			method
			open the
			following
			URL:
			<ulink url="https://git.eclipse.org/r/">Gerrit at Eclipse</ulink>
			and login with your Eclipse account (registered email address) and
			password via the top right corner of your browser.
		</para>
		<para>
			Afterwards
			select
			<guilabel>Settings</guilabel>
			as highlighted in the following screenshot.

		<para>
			You can either use SSH or HTTPS to push to Gerrit. See
			<xref linkend="eclipsegerrit_configuration_https" />
			for the
			configuration of HTTPS and
			<xref linkend="eclipsegerrit_configuration_ssh" />
			for the
			configuration of the SSH access. If you are not familiar with SSH, the HTTPS authentication
			is most likely
			easier to
			configure for you. If your
			company is using a proxy,
			you may have to use HTTPS as some proxies block SSH.

	<section id="eclipsegerrit_configuration_https">
		<title>Authentication via HTTPS</title>
		<para>
			The web page of the Gerrit review system enables you to generate an HTTP password.
			Select the
			<guilabel>HTTP password</guilabel>
			in the Gerrit user settings
			and generate a password. This setting is
			depicted in the
			following screenshot (the password
			is obfuscated).
		</para>

				<textobject>
					<phrase>Eclipse Gerrit HTTPS access</phrase>
				</textobject>
			</mediaobject>
		</para>
		<para>Take note or copy the password, as it will be needed to push your changes
			to
			the Eclipse Gerrit system. In
			contrast to SSH, when
			using HTTPS you will have to enter your password for each operation with Gerrit. You can visit
			this page
			later if you
			forgot
			the password.
		</para>

	<section id="eclipsegerrit_configuration_ssh">
		<title>Authentication via SSH</title>
		<para>
			You need to upload your SSH key to the Gerrit installation so that
			you
			can push
			changes to Gerrit via SSH. Once you have created a SSH key pair, upload your public SSH key
			to Gerrit to be able to push to it.
