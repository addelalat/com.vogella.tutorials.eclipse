== Clone the selected Eclipse Git repository

=== Finding the correct Git repository

Ensure you are logged into the Gerrit server webpage. 
This will enable you to use SSH or HTTPS for cloning the repository.


Go to the https://git.eclipse.org/r/[Gerrit Eclipse homepage] and select the menu:Projects[List] menu entry.
This opens the https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/admin/projects/[Project search page]. 
Here you can search for the project you want to contribute to. 
In our example we want to contribute to the platform.ui project.

Select the correct project. 
This opens a new webpage.
This page contains links for cloning the Git repository.
The selection for HTTPS is depicted in the following screenshot. 
Please note that the URL for you is different, as it contains your user name.

=== Clone the repository via the Eclipse IDE

To clone, select menu:File[Import... > Git > Projects from Git > Clone URI].

Enter the URL from the Gerrit webpage in the first line of the wizard. 
The Eclipse Git tooling removes "git clone" from the clone URI automatically.

Note that the URL automatically includes your user name. 
This makes it easier to push a change to the Eclipse Gerrit review system. 
If you clone the repository using the Eclipse Git functionality, your local repository is already configured to push changes to Gerrit, no additional setup step is required. 
The following screenshot shows this selection, please the depicted user name with yours.

On the next wizard page you can select to clone all branches.
The Eclipse platform project uses the `master` branch for all bug fixes and feature work.
Individual bug fixes are downported to maintenance branches but you should always first fix the issue in the master branch.

Finish this wizard by selecting the btn:[Next] button until you the option _Finish_ option becomes available. 
You end up with the projects from the repository imported into your workspace.
	
NOTE: You can also clone anonymously via _Anonymous HTTP_, if you just want to play with the source code locally and do not intend to contribute changes. 
In case you cloned a Git repository without using the Gerrit URL or not via Eclipse Git you have to adjust the push URL to provide Gerrit changes.
See <<eclipsegerritcontribution_adjustpush>> for a description how to do that.
