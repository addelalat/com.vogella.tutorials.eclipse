== Exercise: make a change and push a review

=== Make a code change

Find a very simple change for your first contribution. For
example fix a typo or a compiler warning. Eclipse
projects
frequently tag bugs with the keyword
_bugday_
or
_helpwanted_
, these are candidates for initial contributions.



=== Push to the Gerrit review system

Use the _Git Staging_ view to commit your change and to push it to the Gerrit review server.


You need to sign off every commit. 
The Git functionality in Eclipse simplifies that via the sign-off push button. 
The _Add Change-Id_ push button allows you to include a Change-Id entry to the commit message. 
Both buttons are highlighted in the following screenshot.

[NOTE]
====
The Change-ID entry is initially set to "Change-Id: I0000000000000000000000000000000000000000". 
During the commit, this is replaced with an ID generated by the Git tooling. 
Like other Git IDs it is a SHA1 over the content of the commit and the letter 'I' is added a prefix to make it obvious that it is a Gerrit Change-Id and not a Git commit ID.
====

WARNING:

To get picked up by Gerrit, the
_Change-Id_
must be in the last paragraph together with the other footers.
To
avoid problems do not separate it from the
_Signed-off-by_
message
with a new-line character.




=== Updating the Gerrit review

You may get review comments asking to improve the Gerrit change. Or you find a better way of doing the change.
You can update an existing Gerrit review by using the same Change-Id for another commit. 
The easiest way of doing this is to amend the last commit and push this commit again to Gerrit.


Since the amended commit contains the same Change-Id as the initial commit, Gerrit knows that you want to update this change with the new commit. 
Also in your local Git repository commit amend replaces the previous commit in your local history (and keep the same parent commit).
