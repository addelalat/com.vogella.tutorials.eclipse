== Eclipse and tests

=== Eclipse projects and their test suite

Most Eclipse projects provide a test suite which can be used to validate that everything still works as planned.
The Gerrit build validation will execute most of them, if you upload them. 
If changes in the tests are required, you should adjust the tests with the same Gerrit change.

NOTE: The target of most projects is to run 100% or the test suite during the Gerrit build validation but due to history reasons that is not always possible.

At the time of this writing, some of the unit tests of the Eclipse projects are still based on JUnit 3.x but most have been migrated to JUnit 4.x.
JUnit 3.x uses the _test_ prefix of method names to identify test methods.

=== Running the Eclipse platform unit tests

==== Repositories for platform tests
        
Clone the following Git repositories as these contain the existing
unit tests. The clone URLs (these are not URLs for
the browser!) are
listed below.


* git://git.eclipse.org/gitroot/platform/eclipse.platform.releng.git
* git://git.eclipse.org/gitroot/platform/eclipse.platform.ui.git
* git://git.eclipse.org/gitroot/platform/eclipse.platform.runtime.git
        
        
Ensure you clone them via the Gerrit system as described in <<eclipsegerritcontribution_cloneviagerrit_server>> to allow code contributons to them.
But you can always adjust the push URL later, as described in <<eclipsegerritcontribution_adjustpush>>.

==== Example: JFace tests

In this section the procedure to run the unit tests of the JFace components is described as an example for running tests from an Eclipse project.
        
The unit tests for the JFace Bundle are placed in the org.eclipse.ui.tests plug-in. 
This plug-in includes also several other tests for the Eclipse platform.ui component.
        
        
To run theses tests, import the following required plug-ins:

* org.eclipse.core.tests.harness from the eclipse.platform.runtime repository
* org.eclipse.core.tests.runtime from the eclipse.platform.runtime repository
* org.eclipse.test.performance from the eclipse.platform.releng repository
* org.eclipse.ui.tests from the eclipse.platform.ui repository
* org.eclipse.ui.tests.harness from the eclipse.platform.ui repository
        
To test the full JFace TestSuite, you only need to run the _JFace-All Tests.launch_ run configuration from the `org.eclipse.ui.tests` plug-in.

=== Running the unit tests on a virtual server


The Eclipse platform unit tests starts an Eclipse IDE and visually interacts with it. 
This screen flickering can be annoying. 
On Unix based system you can also run the user interface tests with a virtual display. 
You can of course run the tests without a virtual server but this makes the execution of the tests faster and allows to developer to continue to work on the same machine.

On Ubuntu you can install the virtual server and the client via the following commands.

[source,console]
----
include::res/vncserver/install.txt[]
----

<1> The client is not required to run the unit tests but useful in case you want to view the test execution on the virtual server.


You start the server with the following parameters.

[source,console]
----
include::res/vncserver/start.txt[]
----


In the Eclipse launch configuration you can define the display which is used for the test execution.

If you are running a Maven / Tycho build from the command line, you can export the display variable.

[source,console]
----
include::res/vncserver/display.txt[]
----

If you want to watch the unit tests, you can also connect to the virtual server via the vncclient.

[source,console]
----
include::res/vncserver/connect.txt[]
