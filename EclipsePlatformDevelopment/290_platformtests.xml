== Running the Eclipse platform unit tests


=== Repositories for platform tests
		
			Clone the following Git repositories as these contain the existing
			unit tests. The clone URLs (these are not URLs for
			the browser!) are
			listed below.

			<itemizedlist>
				*
					
						git://git.eclipse.org/gitroot/platform/eclipse.platform.releng.git
					
				
				*
					
						git://git.eclipse.org/gitroot/platform/eclipse.platform.ui.git
					
				
				*
					
						git://git.eclipse.org/gitroot/platform/eclipse.platform.runtime.git
					
				
			
		
		
			In case you want to contribute Gerrit patches to these
			projects, you
			should clone them via the Gerrit system as described in
			<xref linkend="eclipsegerritcontribution_cloneviagerrit_server" />
			. But you can always adjust the push URL later, as described in
			<xref linkend="eclipsegerritcontribution_adjustpush" />
			.
		
	

=== Example: JFace tests

		
			In this section the procedure to run the
			unit
			tests of the
			JFace
			components
			is described as an example for running
			tests from an
			Eclipse project.
		
		
			The unit tests for the JFace Bundle are placed in the
			org.eclipse.ui.tests plug-in. This plug-in includes also
			several
			other
			tests for the Eclipse platform.ui component.
		


		
			To run theses tests, import the following required plug-ins:
			<itemizedlist>
				*
					org.eclipse.core.tests.harness from the
					eclipse.platform.runtime repository
				
				*
					org.eclipse.core.tests.runtime from the
					eclipse.platform.runtime repository
				
				*
					org.eclipse.test.performance from the
					eclipse.platform.releng repository
				
				*
					org.eclipse.ui.tests from the eclipse.platform.ui
					repository
				
				*
					org.eclipse.ui.tests.harness from the eclipse.platform.ui
					repository
				
			
		



		
			To test the full JFace TestSuite, you only need to run the
			_JFace-All Tests.launch_
			run configuration from the
			`org.eclipse.ui.tests`
			plug-in.
