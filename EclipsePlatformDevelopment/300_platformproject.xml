== Eclipse projects responsible for the Java IDE

=== The Eclipse project
		
		
		
		
		
			The Eclipse IDE is an open source (OS) project. Eclipse.org
			hosts
			lots of OS projects with different purposes, but
			the foundation
			of
			the
			whole Eclipse IDE is delivered by the Eclipse platform, the Java
			development tools (JDT) and the
			Plug-in Development Environment (PDE)
			project.
		
		All these projects belong to the project called "Eclipse
			project". The name is a bit strange since nowadays there
			are many
			Eclipse projects. But it originates from the fact that
			these projects
			were at the beginning the only available
			Eclipse
			projects.
		
		
			These components are bundled together as the Eclipse Standard
			Development Kit (SDK)
			release.
			This is also known as
			the Eclipse
			standard distribution. The
			Eclipse
			SDK contains all tools to develop
			Eclipse plug-ins.
		
		
			In addition to these projects, the platform also has an
			incubator project called
			_e4_
			which provides new tools for Eclipse 4 developments. It also serves
			as a
			testing
			ground for new ideas.
		
	

=== The Eclipse platform projects home pages and Git repositories
		
			The following table lists the home pages of these projects along with the developer pages, which list the Git (and
			Gerrit) repositories.
