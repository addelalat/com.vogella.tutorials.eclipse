== The platform development team

=== Who is involved?


Despite the general assumption that the Eclipse SDK components are developed by an army of developers, the actual core developer team is relatively small.
The _Who's Involved_on the http://projects.eclipse.org/[project page] from can be used to get an overview of the project activities. 
For example, the information of the platform
project is available under https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/eclipse/who[Eclipse platform project page].

[TIP]
====
To find out how many people contribute to a given Eclipse Git repo you can use the following command on a Linux like system. 

[source,console]
----
git log --since='last 3 month' --raw | grep "^Author: " | sort | uniq -c | wc -l

Since the core team of an individual project is relatively small, contributors can really make a difference. 
For example the following screenshot shows a snapshot of the activities of the https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/eclipse.platform.ui/who[Eclipse platform.ui] project.

An alternative view gives the new dashboard. 
For example the following screeenshot shows the http://dashboard.eclipse.org/project.html?project=eclipse.platform.ui[Platform UI] dashboard link.
