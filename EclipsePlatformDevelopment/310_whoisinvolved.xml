[[eclipseplatform_contributions2">
=== Who is involved?

		
			Despite the general assumption that the Eclipse SDK components
			are
			developed by an army of developers, the actual
			core developer
			team
			is
			relatively small.
		
		
			General information about an Eclipse project can be
			found
			under
			http://projects.eclipse.org/">http://projects.eclipse.org/
			. For example
			via the
			_Who's Involved_
			link you can see an overview of the project activities. For
			example,
			the information for
			the
			platform
			project can be found
			under the
			https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/eclipse/who">Eclipse project
			link.

		<tip>
			
				To find out how
				many people contribute to a given Eclipse Git
				repo
				you can use the
				following command on a Linux
				like system. For
				example
				running this
				command shows 27 on July, 07, 2014 result in 27
				people
				contributing
				to the
				platform.ui repository.

		</tip>

		
			Since the core team of an individual project is relatively small,
			contributors can really
			make a difference. For
			example the following screenshot shows a snapshot of the activities of the
			https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/eclipse.platform.ui/who">Eclipse platform.ui project
			.
