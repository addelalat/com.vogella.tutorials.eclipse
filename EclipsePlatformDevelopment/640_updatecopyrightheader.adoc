== Updating the copyright header of a source file


=== Why updating the copyright header of a changed file?
(((Copyright header update)))

The Eclipse project allows you optionally to update the last changed date in the copyright header, if you change the file. 
You can do this manually but the Eclipse releng project also provides tooling for that.
		
NOTE: This used to be mandatory but become an optional step in 2016.

=== Using the Eclipse releng tooling for updating the copyright header
		
You need to install the copyright header tool from the following update site:
http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/updates/4.6
		
Adjust the number "4.6" to the number matching your eclipse version.
