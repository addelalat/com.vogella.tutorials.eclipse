== Tips and tricks

=== "Out-of-office" for Gerrit and Bugzilla

A trick to show other committers and contributors that you are on vacation. 
Gerrit and Bugzilla do not offer that out of the box, but as a nice trick you can change your last name for Eclipse.org to show that.

Go to https://dev.eclipse.org/site_login/myaccount.php#open_tab_profile[Eclipse user profile] and click btn:[edit] for your last name.

After you changed your last name, press btn[Update Account].

Here is an example how this looks like (using another user).

TIP: Remember to reset your name, after you returned from vacation.



=== Updating the copyright header of a source file
(((Copyright header update)))
The Eclipse project allows you optionally to update the last changed date in the copyright header, if you change the file. 
You can do this manually but the Eclipse releng project also provides tooling for that.
		
NOTE: This used to be mandatory but become an optional step in 2016.

You need to install the copyright header tool from the following update site:
http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/updates/4.6
		
Adjust the number "4.6" to the number matching your eclipse version.

After the installation you can select the entry from the context menu of a project or source folder.

=== Debugging GTK elements with GtkInspector

`GtkInspector` is a tool that allows you to debug GTK+ applications.
It was introduced in GTK+ 3.14.
To start Eclipse with the GtkInspector start it with an environment variable set.

[source, terminal]
----
GTK_DEBUG=interactive ./eclipse
----

You can also start the GtkInspector for an already running program.
To do this you have to enable the inspector key bindings.
Under ubuntu you might have to install an additional package to make this option available.

[source, terminal]
----
sudo apt-get install libgtk-3-dev
----

Run this command in your terminal to activate the setting.

[source, terminal]
----
gsettings set org.gtk.Settings.Debug enable-inspector-keybinding true
----

After this the keybinding are activated.
