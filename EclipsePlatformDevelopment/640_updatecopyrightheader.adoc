== Tips and tricks

=== "Out-of-office" for Gerrit and Bugzilla

A trick to show other committers and contributors that you are on vacation. 
Gerrit and Bugzilla do not offer that out of the box, but as a nice trick you can change your last name for Eclipse.org to show that.

Go to https://dev.eclipse.org/site_login/myaccount.php#open_tab_profile[Eclipse user profile] and click btn:[edit] for your last name.

Here is an example how this looks like (using another user).

=== Updating the copyright header of a source file
(((Copyright header update)))

The Eclipse project allows you optionally to update the last changed date in the copyright header, if you change the file. 
You can do this manually but the Eclipse releng project also provides tooling for that.
		
NOTE: This used to be mandatory but become an optional step in 2016.

=== Using the Eclipse releng tooling for updating the copyright header
		
You need to install the copyright header tool from the following update site:
http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/updates/4.6
		
Adjust the number "4.6" to the number matching your eclipse version.

After the installation you can select the entry from the context menu of a project or source folder.
