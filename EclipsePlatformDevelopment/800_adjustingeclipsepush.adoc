== Appendix: Cloning from the Git server and adjusting the push URL

=== Overview

If you cloned an Eclipse Git repository directly from the Eclipse Git server instead of the Gerrit server, you have to adjust the push URL for the usage of Gerrit. 
For example, you may have found the clone URL on the https://git.eclipse.org/c/[Eclipse Git web interface].


It is far easier to clone from the Gerrit server via Eclipse, as this does not require you to change the push URL. 
See <<eclipsegerritcontribution_cloneviagerrit_server>> for the description how to clone. 
In case you can use the Gerrit server, this section is not relevant for you.

The push configuration in the following dialog depends a bit if you want to use SSH or HTTPS. 
If you want to use SSH ensure to use the 29418 port and remove the "gitroot" string from the push-url.

The following screenshot demonstrates that for the Eclipse platform UI Git repository.

If you want to use HTTPS to push to the Gerrit server, you have to use a push URL with an "r" included
(For example
https://userid@git.eclipse.org/r/platform/eclipse.platform.ui.git).
You need to provide in this case your Gerrit password to push to the Eclipse Git repository. 
This is depicted in the following screenshot.

=== Gerrit push configuration

The Gerrit server requires that you push using a predefined _refspec_, called _HEAD:refs/for/master_. 
A refspec allows you to configure which remote branch should be used for remote operations.

If you clonee a Git repository managed by a Gerrit server, this push url is already correctly configured in most cases.

The icon for repository configured to be used for Gerrit uses a green icon. 
Also Gerrit specific commands are added to the repository's context menu, e.g.,_Push to Gerrit..._and_Fetch from Gerrit..._).
In addition, the repository is configured to always add a Change-ID to the commit message.
In th following screenshot the repositories configured for Gerrit are highlighted. 
The `eclipse.jdt` repository in this screenshot is not configured for Gerrit.

If you have to configure the push URL manually, select your remote repository in the _Git Repositories_view, right-click on it and select _Gerrit configuration_.

If you select the _origin_ entry, right mouse click on it and select _Gerrit Configuration..._ the entry should look like the following screenshot.

NOTE: For HTTPS access the URL is different.

To validate the push specification, select the highlighted node in the following screenshot and check the _Remote Push Specification_entry in the _Properties_view.
