== Appendix: Cloning from the Git server and adjusting the push URL

=== Overview
		
			If you cloned an Eclipse Git repository directly from the Eclipse Git
			server (without using the Gerrit server) you
			have to adjust the push
			URL to create Gerrit changes. For example, you may have found the
			clone URL on:
			https://git.eclipse.org/c/">Eclipse Git web interface
			.
		

		
			It is far easier to clone from the Gerrit server as this does not
			require you to change the push URL. See
			<xref linkend="eclipsegerritcontribution_cloneviagerrit_server" />
			for the description how to clone. In case you can use the Gerrit
			server, this section is not relevant for you.
		

		The push configuration in the following dialog depends a bit if
			you want to use SSH or
			HTTPS. If you want to use
			SSH
			ensure to
			use the
			29418 port and remove the
			"gitroot"
			string from the
			push-url.
		
		
			The
			following screenshot
			demonstrates that for the Eclipse
			platform
			UI
			Git
			repository.

		If you want to use HTTPS to push to the Gerrit server, you have
			to
			use a push URL
			with an "r" included
			(For example
			https://userid@git.eclipse.org/r/platform/eclipse.platform.ui.git).
			You need to provide in this case your Gerrit
			password if you want to
			push to an Eclipse Git repository as depicted in the following
			screenshot.

=== Gerrit push configuration
		
			The Gerrit server requires that you push using a predefined
			_refspec_
			, called
			_HEAD:refs/for/master_
			. A refspec allows you to configure which remote branch should
			be used
			for remote operations.
		
		
			If you clone a Git repository managed by a Gerrit server, this push url is already correctly configured in most
			cases.

			The icon for repository configured to be used for Gerrit uses a green icon. Also Gerrit
			specific commands are added to
			the repository's
			context menu, e.g.,
			_Push to Gerrit..._
			and
			_Fetch from Gerrit..._
			). In addition, the repository
			is
			configured to always add a Change-ID
			to the commit message.
			In the
			following
			screenshot
			the repositories configured for
			Gerrit are
			highlighted. The
			`eclipse.jdt`
			repository in this screenshot is not configured for Gerrit.

			If you have to configure the push URL manually, select your remote repository in the
			_Git Repositories_
			view, right-click on
			it and select
			_Gerrit configuration_
			.

			If you select the
			_origin_
			entry, right mouse click on it and select
			_Gerrit Configuration..._
			the entry should look like the following screenshot.

		NOTE:
			For HTTPS access the URL is different.
		</note>
		
			You can validate the push specification if you select the
			highlighted
			node in the following screenshot and check the
			_Remote Push Specification_
			entry in the
			_Properties_
			view.
