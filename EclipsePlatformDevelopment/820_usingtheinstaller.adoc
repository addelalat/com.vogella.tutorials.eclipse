== Using the Eclipse installer for code contributions

You can also use the Eclipse installer (which is provided by the Eclipse Oomph project) to automated some of the
steps of code contributions. Please note that the
Eclipse installer is currently still under heavy development and the
user interface might change significantly.

Download for this, the Eclipse installer from https://www.eclipse.org/downloads[Eclipse installer].
Depending your operating system you have to extract it, or you can just run the executable.

Start it and select the _Advanced Mode_.

Select _Eclipse IDE for Java Developers_.


Afterwards you can select the project you want to contribute to. 
If this project maintains a correct Oomph configuration will clone the corresponding repository and configure your workspace. 
The following screenshots are from JDT UI, for which the Eclipse installer configuration is valid as the time of this writing.

You end up with a workspace with the existing Git repositories. 
After this initial setup you should consult the contribution guide of the project to ensure you know their contribution guidelines.
