	<title>Extending the Eclipse IDE</title>
	<para>The Eclipse IDE is basically an Eclipse RCP application to support development activities. Even core
		functionality of the Eclipse IDE is provided via a plug-in, for example the Java development or the C
		development tools
		are contributed as a set of plug-ins. Only if these plug-ins are present the Java or C development
		capabilities are
		available.
	</para>
	<para>The Eclipse IDE functionality is heavily based on the concept of extensions and extension points. For example the
		Java Development Tools provide an extension point to register new code templates for the Java editor.
	</para>

	<para>
		Via additional
		plug-ins you can contribute to an existing
		functionality, for example
		new menu
		entries, new
		toolbar
		entries
		or provide
		completely
		new functionality. But you can also create completely new programming environments.
