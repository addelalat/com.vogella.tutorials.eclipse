== Download the Eclipse SDK

	If you plan to add functionalities to the Eclipse platform, you should download the latest Eclipse release.
		Official releases have stable APIs, therefore are a good foundation for adding your plug-ins and features.
	

	
		The Eclipse IDE is provided in different flavors. While you can
		install the necessary tools in any Eclipse
		package, it is typically
		easier to download
		the Eclipse Standard distribution which contains all
		necessary tools
		for
		plug-in development. Other packages adds more tools
		which are not required for Eclipse plug-in development.
	
	
		Browse to the
		http://www.eclipse.org/downloads">Eclipse download site
		and
		download the
		_Eclipse Standard_
		package.
