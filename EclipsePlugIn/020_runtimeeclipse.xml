		<para>
			During the development of plug-ins targeting the Eclipse IDE you frequently have
			to
			deploy your plug-ins into a
			new Eclipse
			IDE
			instance to test your
			development.
		</para>
		<para>
			As this is a very common requirement, it is possible to start an instance of the Eclipse IDE
			from another Eclipse IDE
			instance. This is sometimes called a
			<wordasword>runtime Eclipse IDE</wordasword>
			. For this you specify the set of plug-ins which should be included in the Eclispe instance via a run
			Configuration.

			The easiest way to create a run configuration for an Eclipse IDE is by selecting
			<menuchoice>
				<guimenu>Run As</guimenu>
				<guisubmenu>Eclipse Application</guisubmenu>
			</menuchoice>
			from the context menu of an
			existing plug-in or your manifest file. By default, this takes all
			the plug-ins from the
			workspace
			and
			the
			target environment, and start
			an
			Eclipse IDE
			instance with these plug-ins. If a plug-in is available in
			the workspace and the target environment, the one from the workspace is used.

		<title>Debugging the Eclipse instance</title>
		<para>
			You can debug the Eclipse IDE itself.
			Put a breakpoint in a line of the
			source code
			which
			you want to
			inspect, right-click
			your
			plug-in and select
			<menuchoice>
				<guimenu>Debug As</guimenu>
				<guisubmenu>Eclipse Application</guisubmenu>
			</menuchoice>
			. This creates a run configuration if it does not already exist.
		</para>

		<para>
			When the flow will reach a statement marked with a breakpoint, the execution stops, and you are able to
			debug the
			related statement, and to inspect the current data.
