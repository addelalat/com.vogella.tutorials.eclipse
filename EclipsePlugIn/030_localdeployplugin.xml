			You have several options to make your plug-in available in your
			Eclipse IDE. You can:
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>Install your plug-in directly into your current Eclipse installation, using your Eclipse IDE. This
						option is
						useful for
						a quick
						installation and a test during development.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Export your plug-in and copy it into the
						<filename>dropins</filename>
						folder of your Eclipse installation. This option is useful for a simple distribution scenario,
						where you only have
						to
						provide the exported plug-in to
						your users. On
						the other hand it is not very convenient for the end user as it
						requires manual file copying and
						provides no simple way to update
						the plug-in.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Create an update site and use the Eclipse update manager
						to
						install it from this site. This is the simplest
						approach for the end user. It also allows providing updates to all interested users.

		<para>
			You can create an update site for your plug-in. An update
			site
			consists of static files, which can be placed on a
			file server or
			a
			web
			server. Other users can install Eclipse plug-in from this update
			site
			by providing them a link to the
			update site.
		</para>

		<para>
			This
			requires that you create a
			feature project for the plug-in.
			You can
			export this feature project and use the
			Eclipse update manager
			to
			install the
			feature (with the plug-in).
		</para>

		<para>
			By
			default, the
			Eclipse update manager shows
			only features
			included into a
			category. Therefore, you
			should always
			use a
			category for your
			exported
			feature to make it
			easy for the user to install your feature.
