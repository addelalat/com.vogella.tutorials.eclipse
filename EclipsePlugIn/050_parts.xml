== Adding Eclipse 4.x parts and perspectives to 3.x based applications

=== Adding Eclipse 4.x parts to Eclipse 3.x applications
		As a reminder, the term POJO (Plan Old Java Object) is used to
			describe a Java class without inheritance of a
			framework class.
		
		
			As of the Eclipse 4.4 release you can also use a POJO in an extension for the
			`org.eclipse.ui.views`
			extension point. Use the
			_e4view_
			entry in the context menu of the extension to archive this.
			The resulting object is
			created via dependency injection.
		

		
			For such a kind of view the existing toolbar and view extension point contributions do not work. To add for example a
			toolbar to
			your e4view, get
			the
			`MToolbar`
			injected into its implementation and construct the entries in your source code.
		

	


=== Supporting part descriptors in an Eclipse 4.5 IDE
		
			The Eclipse 4.5 IDE release will support the
			contribution
			of part descriptor
			model elements
			via fragments or
			processors.
		
		
			If you use the
			<parameter>org.eclipse.e4.legacy.ide.application</parameter>
			ID to contribute your part descriptors, the views can be opened via the
			menu:Window[Show View > Other...]
			dialog or via the
			_Quick Access_
			. This requires that you add the
			<parameter>View</parameter>
			tag to such a part descriptor.
		
		Eclipse 3.x API RCP applications running on
			top of a 4.5 or higher runtime can use the same
			approach.
		


	


=== Adding perspectives to the Eclipse IDE via model snippets
		
		
			Your model fragment or processor can also contribute a
			perspective to
			an Eclipse 4.x IDE. For this
			add a perspective via
			a snippet. This snippet must again contribute to the application via
			the
			<parameter>org.eclipse.e4.legacy.ide.application</parameter> ID.
		
		This approach can also be used to contribute a perspective to
			your Eclipse 3.x API based RCP application running
			on top of an
			Eclipse 4.x runtime but this depends on the specifics of your
			application.
