== Exercise: Adding e4view based parts to 3.x based applications

=== Target
		In this exercise you create an Eclipse 3.x RCP application and add a POJO part to it based on the e4view element
			available to contribute an extension point based view.
		

	

=== Using e4part and the org.eclipse.ui.views extension point
		
			Create an Eclipse 3.x RCP application based on the
			_RCP application with a view_
			template via
			menu:File[New > Other... > Plug-in Project]
			. Call the project
			_com.vogella.rcp.eclipse3x.e4view_
			and select the options similar to the following screenshots.

			Add
			`org.eclipse.e4.ui.di`
			as a dependency to the manifest of your new plug-in.
		

		
			Create the following class.
		
		
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/migration/ViewEclipse4x.java" />
			</programlisting>
		
		
			Afterwards add an
			_e4view_
			extension for the
			`org.eclipse.ui.views`
			extension point. For this use the
			_Extensions_
			tab
			of the
			_plugin.xml_
			editor.
