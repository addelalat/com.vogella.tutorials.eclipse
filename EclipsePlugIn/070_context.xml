	<title>Accessing the IEclipseContext from 3.x API
	
		The Eclipse 4.x IDE uses the
		<code>IEclipseContext</code>
		data structure
		to store central
		information about the IDE. You can access this information also via
		the Eclipse 3.x API.
		This approach
		is demonstrated with the following snippets. These code snippets assume that you are familiar
		with the 3.x
		API, if that is not the case you can skip this section.
	

	For example, to access the context from an Eclipse 3.x API view, you can use the
		following snippet.
	
	
		<programlisting language="java">
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/context/View.java" />
		</programlisting>
	

	This snippet demonstrates the access via an Eclipse 3.x API handler. 
	
		<programlisting language="java">
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/context/Access.java" />
		</programlisting>
