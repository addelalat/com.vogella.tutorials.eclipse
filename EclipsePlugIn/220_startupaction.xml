== Early startup actions
	
		The Eclipse platform provides the
		`org.eclipse.ui.startup`
		extension point via the
		`org.eclipse.ui`
		plug-in.
	
	NOTE:
		This extension point is not used for Eclipse 4 RCP applications,
			use a life cycle hook or model add-on to archive
			similar behavior.
		
	</note>

	
		To implement an extension to this extension point, select
		_Add..._
		on the
		_Extensions_
		tab of the
		_plugin.xml_
		editor and point to a class implementing the
		`IStartup`
		interface.
