== Adapters

=== What are adapters?
		
			Adapters help to display information about objects in view
			without having to adjust the existing views. In this
			example we will
			create a small view which allows to select objects and use the
			properties view to display them.
		
		
			Adapters are used on several places, for example, you can use an
			adapter to display your data in the outline view. See
			http://www.eclipsezone.com/eclipse/forums/t101941.html">
				Outline View Example for an example
			
			on how to do this.
		

	

=== Example
		
			We will simply use an adapter to show our data in the property
			view. Create a new plug-in project
			<property>de.vogella.plugin.adapter</property>
			. Use
			the
			_Plug-in with a view_
			template with the following settings.

				</imageobject>
			</mediaobject>
		
		
			Add the
			dependency
			_org.eclipse.ui.views_
			in tab dependencies of
			_plugin.xml_
			.
		
		 Create the following data model.
		
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/adapter/Todo.java[]
----
		

		
			Change the code of
			_SampleView.java_
			to the following. After this
			change, you should be able to run your project, open your view and see
			your to-do items.
		

		
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/adapter/SampleView.java[]
----
		

		
			To displays its values in the property view, add the extension
			point
			_org.eclipse.core.runtime.adapters_
			to your project. The data
			of the extension point should be like the following.
		

		
			<programlisting language="xml">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/adapter/extension.adoc[]
			</programlisting>
		
		
			Implement the factory and the new class
			`TodoPropertySource`
			which implements
			`IPropertySource`
			.
		

		
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/adapter/TodoAdapterFactory.java[]
----
		

		
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/adapter/TodoPropertySource.java[]
----
		


		
			If you run your workbench and open your view
			via
			menu:Windows[Show > View > Others > Sample Category > Sample View]
			and if you select a data element in your viewer you should see your data in the _Properties_ view.
