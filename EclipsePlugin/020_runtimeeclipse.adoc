== Starting an Eclipse instance (Runtime Eclipse)

=== Starting the Eclipse IDE from Eclipse

During the development of plug-ins targeting the Eclipse IDE you frequently have to deploy your plug-ins into a new Eclipse IDE instance to test your development.

As this is a very common requirement, it is possible to start an instance of the Eclipse IDE from another Eclipse IDE instance.
This is sometimes called a _runtime Eclipse IDE_.
For this you specify the set of plug-ins which should be included in the Eclispe instance via a run Configuration.

=== Starting a new Eclipse instance

The easiest way to create a run configuration for an Eclipse IDE is by selecting
menu:Run As[Eclipse Application] from the context menu of an existing plug-in or your manifest file.
By default, this takes all the plug-ins from the workspace and the target environment, and start an Eclipse IDE instance with these plug-ins.
If a plug-in is available in the workspace and the target environment, the one from the workspace is used.

=== Debugging the Eclipse instance

You can debug the Eclipse IDE itself.
Put a breakpoint in a line of the source code which you want to inspect, right-click your plug-in and select
menu:Debug As[Eclipse Application].
This creates a run configuration if it does not already exist.

When the flow will reach a statement marked with a breakpoint, the execution stops, and you are able to debug the related statement, and to inspect the current data.
