== Adding e4 commands, menus and toolbars to a 3.x API based applications

=== Adding e4 menu entries

Menus, handlers and commands can be contributed to an Eclipse application via model fragments.
To do this, you only need to know the ID of the element to which you want to contribute.
The ID of the Eclipse IDE and Eclipse 3.x RCP applications is hard coded to the `org.eclipse.e4.legacy.ide.application` value.

TIP: You can use the model spy from the e4 tools project to identify the ID of the element you want to contribute too.
See <<modelspyintroduction>>.

With the correct ID you can create model fragments that contribute to the corresponding application model element.
The following screenshot demonstrate how to contribute to the _menuContributions_ feature of the Eclipse IDE.

After you added a MenuContribution item you can contribute a menu.
The `Parent-ID` must be the ID of the menu your are contributing to.

The model fragment must be registered in the plugin.xml file via an extension to the `org.eclipse.e4.workbench.model` extension point, as demonstrated in the following listing.

[source, xml]

=== Error analysis

In case of problems, check the source code of plugin.xml and validate that your model fragment is included.
Verify the name of the referred model fragment and ensure all the defined ID are available in the running configuration.

=== Adding e4 toolbar entries to the appliation window

Similar to menus you can contribute toolbar contributions.
This is demonstrated in <<firstplugin_migratione4_toolbar>>.

NOTE: This approach does currently not work for view toolbars.
