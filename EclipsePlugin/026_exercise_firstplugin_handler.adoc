== Exercise: Add a e4 menu and toolbar to the Eclipse IDE

In this exercise you create a plug-in which contributes an e4 menu entry to a 3.x based application menu.

=== Creating a plug-in project

Create a new plug-in project called `com.vogella.plugin.first`
via
menu:File[New > Project... > Plug-in Development >Plug-in Project]

Enter the data as depicted in the following screenshots.

Press the btn:[Next] button.

Press the btn:[Next] button.

Select the _Hello, World Command_ template and press the btn:[Next] button. 
This template uses the 3.x API, which you convert later in this exercise to the e4 API.

In the last page of the wizard you can customize some suggested values. You can leave the default values and press the btn:[Finish] button.

Eclipse may ask you if you want to switch to the plug-in development perspective.
Answer _Yes_ if you are prompted.

As a result the following project is created.

=== Starting an Eclipse runtime IDE with your plug-in

Start a new Eclipse IDE instance and validate that your menu and toolbar entry are available.
See <<runtimeeclipse_starting>> for more information on how to start an instance of the Eclipse IDE with additional plug-ins.

After launching the Eclipse IDE instance, you see the sample menu, contributed by your plug-in.
After clicking the menu entry, you see a message box.

=== Adding the plug-in dependencies for the e4 API

Add a dependency to the `org.eclipse.e4.core.di`
plug-in in the manifest file of the newly created plug-in.

=== Creating the handler class

Create the following class based on the generated handler class.

[source, java]
----
include::./res/first/SampleE4Handler.java[]
----

=== Creating a model contribution

Select menu:New[Other... > Eclipse 4 > Model >New Model Fragment] from the context menu of the plug-in project.

Press the btn:[Finish] button.

Create three model fragment entries in your new file, all of them should be contributing to the `org.eclipse.e4.legacy.ide.application` element id.

TIP: Since Eclipse 4.5 (Mars) XPaths can be used to address certain elements in the application model. So instead of using `org.eclipse.e4.legacy.ide.application` as element id `xpath:/` can be used. Using XPaths is the preferred way, because it provides more flexibility.

Use the following screenshots to define the new contribution.

=== Adding a toolbar contribution

Also add a toolbar contribution for the same command.

WARNING: When this document was written, the model editor had a bug.
If you enter a _Parent-ID_ to the toolbar contribution, that information is not persisted in the xmi code.
Therefore, ensure that your settings are actually reflected in the fragment file.
You can do this by closing the file and opening it again.
If you read this and the bug is still present, you have to enter the
Parent-ID directly in the xmi.
For this switch to the XMI tab of the editor and enter the parent ID directly.
Use the `org.eclipse.ui.main.toolbar` value.
The file is only saved, if you enter the information syntactically correct.

=== Validating the presence of the menu and toolbar contribution

Start a new instance of the Eclipse IDE and validate that your menu and the toolbar are is contributed.
If they are not visible in the window, check via the model spy for potential issues.
