== Local deployment of your plug-in

=== Options for installing a plug-in

You have several options to make your plug-in available in your Eclipse IDE.
You can:
* Install your plug-in directly into your current Eclipse installation, using your Eclipse IDE.
This option is useful for a quick installation and a test during development.

* Export your plug-in and copy it into the _dropins_ folder of your Eclipse installation.
This option is useful for a simple distribution scenario, where you only have to provide the exported plug-in to your users.
On the other hand it is not very convenient for the end user as it requires manual file copying and provides no simple way to update the plug-in.

* Create an update site and use the Eclipse update manager to install it from this site.
This is the simplest approach for the end user.
It also allows providing updates to all interested users.

=== Installing your plug-in from your Eclipse IDE

You can install your plug-in directly into your running Eclipse IDE.

The Eclipse plug-in export wizard has an option for this.
Open the export wizard via menu:File[Export >Plug-in Development >Deployable plug-ins and fragments].

In the export wizard dialog select in this case _Install into host. Repository_.
This is depicted in the following screenshot.

=== Export plug-in and put into dropins folder

If you export your plug-in locally, you can put it into the Eclipse icon:folder[] _dropins_ folder of your Eclipse installation.
After a restart of your Eclipse your plug-in should be available and ready for use.

Open again the export wizard via menu:File[Export > Plug-in Development>Deployable plug-ins and fragments].

Select the plug-in you want to export and the folder to which this plug-in should get exported.

Press the btn:[Finish] button.
This creates a _JAR_ file with the exported plug-in in the selected directory.

Copy this _JAR_ file to the icon:folder[] _dropins_ directory in your Eclipse installation directory and restart your running Eclipse.

After this restart your new plug-in is available in your Eclipse installation and ready to be used.

=== Deployment using an update site

You can create an update site for your plug-in.
An update site consists of static files, which can be placed on a file server or a web server.
Other users can install Eclipse plug-in from this update site by providing them a link to the update site.

This requires that you create a feature project for the plug-in.
You can export this feature project and use the Eclipse update manager to install the feature (with the plug-in).

By default, the Eclipse update manager shows only features included into a category.
Therefore, you should always use a category for your exported feature to make it easy for the user to install your feature.
