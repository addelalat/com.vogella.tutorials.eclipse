=== Install feature via the Eclipse update manager
Use the Eclipse update manager via menu:Help[Install New Software...] to install this new feature into your Eclipse IDE.

Use the update manager to point to your local directory.
Then select and install your feature.
In case you don't see your feature, try deselecting the _Group items by category_ flag.
In this case, you have forgotten to set your category during the export.

NOTE: If you put the resulting files on a webserver under a public accessible URL, your users could install your features from this URL.

=== Validate installation

Restart the Eclipse IDE after the installation.
Ensure that your plug-in is available in your Eclipse installation and can be used.
