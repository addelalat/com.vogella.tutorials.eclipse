== Exercise: Adding e4view based parts to 3.x based applications

=== Target

In this exercise you create an Eclipse 3.x RCP application and add a POJO part to it based on the e4view element available to contribute an extension point based view.

=== Using e4part and the org.eclipse.ui.views extension point

Create an Eclipse 3.x RCP application based on the _RCP application with a view_ template via menu:File[New > Other... > Plug-in Project].
Call the project _com.vogella.rcp.eclipse3x.e4view_ and select the options similar to the following screenshots.

Add `org.eclipse.e4.ui.di` as a dependency to the manifest of your new plug-in.

Create the following class.

[source, java]

include::examples/migration/ViewEclipse4x.java[]
----

Afterwards add an _e4view_ extension for the `org.eclipse.ui.views` extension point.
For this use the _Extensions_ tab of the _plugin.xml_ editor.
