== Exercise: Adding e4 part descriptors to 3.x based applications

=== Target

In this exercise you add a model based part contribution to an Eclipse 3.x RCP application.

=== Adding a part descriptor

Create a simple plug-in called `com.vogella.plugin.partdescriptor`.

Add the following dependencies to your manifest file.

* org.eclipse.core.runtime
* org.eclipse.jface
* org.eclipse.e4.ui.model.workbench
* org.eclipse.e4.ui.di

Create the following class

[source, java]
----
include::examples/migration/PartEclipse4x.java[]
----

Add a new model fragment to this plug-in via menu:File[New > Other... >Eclipse 4 > Model >New Model Fragment].

=== Validating
Start an instance of the Eclipse IDE and validate that you can open the parts via the Quick Access box (shortcut Ctrl+3).

NOTE:In Eclipse 4.4 the part descriptor can only be opened via the Quick Access box.
In Eclipse 4.5 it is planned that it can also be opened via the menu:Window[Show View] menu entry.
