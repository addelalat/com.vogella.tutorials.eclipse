== Contribute a menu to existing Part


=== Overview

In this example we will add a new context menu entry to the _Package Explorer_ part.
The context menu is displayed if the user selects a file in the package explorer via a right mouse click.
We will offer the option to create a HTML page from a Java source file.

To contribute to an existing menu or toolbar, you need to know the corresponding ID.
This ID can be found via the _Menu Spy_.
To start the Menu Spy use ALT + Shift + F2 and click on the menu entry you are interested in.


=== Contribute to the Package Explorer
Create a new plug-in project called _de.vogella.plugin.htmlconverter_.
Do not use a template.

Open the _META-INF/MANIFEST.MF_ file.
Select the _Dependencies_ tab and add the following dependencies to your plug-in.

* org.eclipse.jdt.core
* org.eclipse.core.runtime
* org.eclipse.core.resources
* org.eclipse.core.expressions

Open the _Extensions_ tab in your editor, or if the tab is not visible, click the _Extensions_ link on the _Overview_ tab.
Add a command with the ID `de.vogella.plugin.htmlconverter.convert` and the default handler `de.vogella.plugin.htmlconverter.handler.ConvertHandler` to your plug-in.

Add this command to the menu via the extension point `org.eclipse.ui.menus` and use _popup:org.eclipse.jdt.ui.PackageExplorer_ as the _locationURI_.
Set the label to _Create HTML_ for this contribution.

The resulting file _plugin.xml_ should look like the following.

[source, xml]
----
include::res/htmlconverter/pluginsimple.xml[]
----

Eclipse allows to save additional information for each file.
You can use the `IResource` interface and the `setPersistentProperty()` and `getPersistentProperty()` methods. With these functions you can save Strings on files.
We use these functions to save a directory for Java source files which were already exported via HTML.

Create the following `ConvertHandler` class.

[source, java]
----
include::res/htmlconverter/ConvertHandler.java[]
----

If you start this plug-in, you should be able to create HTML output from a Java source file.

=== Restrict the extension - Visible When

Currently our context menu is displayed all the time.
We would like to show it only if a source file is selected.
For this we will use a "visible-when" definition.

Add the _org.eclipse.core.expressions_ plug-in as dependency to your plug-in.
Select your menu contribution.
Using the right mouse add the condition to the command that it should only be visible if a file is selected		which represents a `ICompilationUnit` from the `org.eclipse.jdt.core` package.

For this exercise you use the predefined variable _activeMenuSelection_ which contains the selection in the menu and iterate over it.
If the selection can get adapted to `ICompilationUnit`, then the contribution will be visible.

This will result in the following _plugin.xml_

[source, xml]
----
include::res/htmlconverter/plugin.xml[]
----

If you now start your plug-in, the menu entry should only be visible if at least one compilation unit has been selected.
