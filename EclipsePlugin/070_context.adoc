== Accessing the IEclipseContext from 3.x API

The Eclipse 4.x IDE uses the `IEclipseContext` data structure to store central information about the IDE.
You can access this information also via the Eclipse 3.x API.
This approach is demonstrated with the following snippets.
These code snippets assume that you are familiar with the 3.x API, if that is not the case you can skip this section.

For example, to access the context from an Eclipse 3.x API view, you can use the following snippet.
