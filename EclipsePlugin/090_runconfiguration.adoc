== The usage of run configurations

=== What are run configurations?

A _run configuration_ defines the environment which will be used to execute a generic launch.
For example, it defines arguments to the Java virtual machine (VM), plug-in (classpath) dependencies, etc.

If you start an Eclipse application the corresponding run configuration is automatically created or updated.

TIP: If you are starting an Eclipse runtime IDE for testing, and clear the workspace location the next run will prompt you to choose a workspace.

=== Reviewing run configurations

To review and edit your run configurations select menu:Run[Run Configurations...] from the Eclipse menu.

On the _Main_ tab in the field _Location_, you specify where the Eclipse IDE creates the files necessary to start your Eclipse based application.

=== Defining arguments
(((Run arguments, Run configuration arguments)))
(((Run configuration arguments, consoleLog)))
(((Run configuration arguments, console)))
(((Run configuration arguments, nl)))
(((Run configuration arguments, noExit)))
(((Run configuration arguments, clearPersistedState)))
The run configuration allows you to add additional start arguments for your application on the _Arguments_ tab.
By default Eclipse includes already several parameters, e.g. parameters for _-os_,_-ws_ and _-arch_ to specify the architecture on which the application is running.

[TIP]
====
To pass system properties to your Eclipse application, you can add launch parameters using the -D switch.
As example, if you add the argument _-Dmy.product.loglevel=INFO_, you can get the "INFO" value with `System.getProperties("my.product.loglevel")`.

The following table lists several useful launch arguments.

.Launch parameters
[cols="1,3",options="header"]
|===

|Parameter |Description

|_consoleLog_
|Error messages of the running Eclipse application are written to standard-out (`System.out`) which can be viewed in the Eclipse IDE _Console_ view that started the RCP application.

|_nl_
|Specifies the locale used for your application.
The locale defines the language specific settings, i.e., which translation is used and the number, date and currency formatting.
For example _-nl en_ starts your application using the English language.
This is useful for testing translations.

|_console_
|Provides access to an OSGi console where you can check the status of your application.

|_noExit_
|Keeps the OSGi console open even if the application crashes.
This allows to analyze the application dependencies even if the application crashes during startup.

|_clearPersistedState_
|Deletes cached runtime changes of the Eclipse 4 application model.
|===

=== Launch configuration and Eclipse products

If you are developing Eclipse RCP applications, the launch configuration is created based on the product configuration file.
The launch configuration is updated every time you start your application via the product.

You can use the created run configuration directly for starting the application again.
In this case changes in the product configuration file are not considered.


[WARNING] 
====
Using an existing run configuration is a common source of frustration and time consuming error analysis. 
To ensure that you use the latest configuration from your product, start your application via the product file.

=== Checklist for common launch problems


Errors in the run configurations of Eclipse RCP application are frequently the source of problems.
This chapter describes common problems related to the start of RCP applications.
It can be used as a reference in case you face issues during the startup of your application.


The most common problem is that some required plug-ins are missing in your product.
If you are using a feature based product configuration, you need to ensure that all plug-ins which are referred to in the MANIFEST.MF file are also included in your features. This error is reported in the _Console_ view, typically it is one of the first error messages and you need to scroll up to see it.

The following listing shows how this message typically looks like (formating changed to make the text fit better).

[source,java]
----
org.osgi.framework.BundleException: 
   Could not resolve module: com.example.e4.rcp.todo.services [9]
      Unresolved requirement: 
         Require-Bundle: com.example.e4.rcp.todo.events; 
            bundle-version="1.0.0"
----

After identifying the missing plug-ins ensure that you add them to your product (if the product is plug-in based) or to your features (if the product is feature based).


[TIP]
====
Eclipse can check for missing dependencies automatically before you run the Launch configuration.
On the _Plug-ins_ Tab press the btn:[Validate Plug-ins] button or select the _Validate plug-ins automatically prior to launching_ option.
This will check if you have all the required plug-ins in your run configuration.

====

Avoid fixing problems with dependencies in the run configuration because the run configuration is created and updated based on the product configuration file.
So always ensure that the product file is correctly configured instead of changing the derived information.
The product configuration is used for the export of your product, hence an error in the product dependencies results in an exported application which cannot be started.



The following table lists potential problems and solutions.

|Problem |Investigate

|"Could not resolve module" message during start up.
|Check that all required plug-ins are included in your product configuration.
Make sure that your product defines dependencies to all required plug-ins or features. See the beginning of this section for a description how to solve the problem.

Bundles may also require a certain version of the Java virtual machine, e.g., a bundle may require Java 1.6 and will therefore not load in a Java 1.5 VM. Check the _MANIFEST.MF_ file on the _Overview_ tab in the _Execution Environments_ section which Java version is required.

|"java.lang.RuntimeException: No application id has been found." message during start up.
|See "Could not resolve module" message during start up error.
In most cases also triggered by a missing plug-in dependency.

|Strange behavior but no error message.
|Check if your run configuration includes the _-consoleLog_ parameter.
This option allows you to see errors from Eclipse based applications in the _Console_ view of the Eclipse IDE.

|Runtime configuration is frequently missing required plug-ins
|Make sure that your product or your feature(s) includes all required dependencies.

|A change in the product _Dependencies_ tab is not reflected in the run configuration (e.g., a new plug-in is added but is not included in the run configuration)
|A product updates an existing run configuration if you start the product directly from the product definition file.
If you select the run configuration directly, it will not be updated.

|Application model changes are not reflected in the Eclipse 4 application.
|Eclipse 4 persists user changes in the application in a delta file which is restored at startup.
During development this might lead to situations where model changes are not correctly applied to the runtime model, e.g., you define a new menu entry and this entry is not displayed in your application.
Either set the _Clear_ flag on the _Main_ tab in your run configuration or add the _clearPersistedState_ parameter for your product configuration file or run configuration.

|Services, e.g., key bindings or the selection service, are not working in an Eclipse 4 application.
|In Eclipse releases before 4.3 every part needed to implement a `@Focus` method which places the focus on an SWT control.
This error does not occur anymore with Eclipse 4.3 or a higher release.

|Menu entries are disabled in the Eclipse application.
|Ensure that the `HandlerProcessingAddon` class in the package `org.eclipse.e4.ui.internal.workbench.addons` is registered as model add-on.
The bundle symbolic name is `org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench`.

|Application "org.eclipse.ant.core.antRunner" could not be found in the registry or Application could not be found in the registry.
|Ensure that you have pressed the btn:[New...] button in the product configuration file and selected the `E4Application` as application to start.
You can check the current setting in your _plugin.xml_ file on the _Extensions_ tab and in the details of the _org.eclipse.core.runtime.products_ extension.

|" Unresolved requirement: Require-Capability: osgi.extender; filter:='(&(osgi.extender=osgi.component)(version>=1.2)(!(version>=2.0)))' " message during start up or validation.
|Add `org.eclipse.equinox.ds` and its dependencies to the product. Ensure you check the consistency of your product with the Validate button.

|"Event Admin service is not available, unable to publish event org.osgi.service.event.Event" message during start up.
|Add `org.eclipse.equinox.event` and its dependencies to the product. Ensure you check the consistency of your product with the Validate button.
