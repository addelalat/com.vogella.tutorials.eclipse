== Common launch problems

=== Checklist for common launch problems

Errors in the run configurations of Eclipse RCP application are frequently the source of problems.
This chapter describes common problems related to the start of RCP applications.
It can be used as a reference in case you face issues during the startup of your
application.
The following table lists potential problems and solutions.

|Problem |Investigate

|"Could not resolve module" message during start up.
|Check that all required plug-ins are included in your product configuration.
Make sure that your product defines dependencies to all required plug-ins or features. See <<runconfiguration_mainproblem>>

Bundles may also require a certain version of the Java virtual machine, e.g., a bundle may require Java 1.6 and will therefore not load in a Java 1.5 VM. Check the _MANIFEST.MF_ file on the _Overview_ tab in the _Execution Environments_ section which Java version is required.

|"java.lang.RuntimeException: No application id has been found." message during start up.
|See "Could not resolve module" message during start up error.
In most cases also triggered by a missing plug-in dependency.

|Strange behavior but no error message.
|Check if your run configuration includes the _-consoleLog_ parameter.
This option allows you to see errors from Eclipse based applications in the _Console_ view of the Eclipse IDE.

|Runtime configuration is frequently missing required plug-ins
|Make sure that your product or your feature(s) includes all required dependencies.

|A change in the product _Dependencies_ tab is not reflected in the run configuration (e.g., a new plug-in is added but is not included in the run configuration)
|A product updates an existing run configuration if you start the product directly from the product definition file.
If you select the run configuration directly, it will not be updated.

|Application model changes are not reflected in the Eclipse 4 application.
|Eclipse 4 persists user changes in the application in a delta file which is restored at startup.
During development this might lead to situations where model changes are not correctly applied to the runtime model, e.g., you define a new menu entry and this entry is not displayed in your application.
Either set the _Clear_ flag on the _Main_ tab in your run configuration or add the _clearPersistedState_ parameter for your product configuration file or run configuration.

|Services, e.g., key bindings or the selection service, are not working in an Eclipse 4 application.
|In Eclipse releases before 4.3 every part needed to implement a `@Focus` method which places the focus on an SWT control.
This error does not occur anymore with Eclipse 4.3 or a higher release.

|Menu entries are disabled in the Eclipse application.
|Ensure that the `HandlerProcessingAddon` class in the package `org.eclipse.e4.ui.internal.workbench.addons` is registered as model add-on.
The bundle symbolic name is `org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench`.

|Application "org.eclipse.ant.core.antRunner" could not be found in the registry or Application could not be found in the registry.
|Ensure that you have pressed the btn:[New...] button in the product configuration file and selected the `E4Application` as application to start.
You can check the current setting in your _plugin.xml_ file on the _Extensions_ tab and in the details of the _org.eclipse.core.runtime.products_ extension.

=== Finding missing plug-in dependencies during a product launch
(((Finding missing plug-in dependencies during a product launch)))
(((Launch configuration, Problems)))

The most common problem is that some required plug-ins are missing in your product.
If you are using a feature based product configuration, you need to ensure that all plug-ins which are referred to in the MANIFEST.MF file are also included in your features. This error is reported in the _Console_ view, typically it is one of the first error messages and you need to scroll up to see it.

The following listing shows how this message typically looks like (formating changed to make the text fit better).

[source,java]
----
org.osgi.framework.BundleException: 
   Could not resolve module: com.example.e4.rcp.todo.services [9]
      Unresolved requirement: 
         Require-Bundle: com.example.e4.rcp.todo.events; 
            bundle-version="1.0.0"
----

After identifying the missing plug-ins ensure that you add them to your product (if the product is plug-in based) or to your features (if the product is feature based).


[TIP]
====
Eclipse can check for missing dependencies automatically before you run the Launch configuration.
On the _Plug-ins_ Tab press the btn:[Validate Plug-ins] button or select the _Validate plug-ins automatically prior to launching option.
This will check if you have all the required plug-ins in your run configuration.

====

Avoid fixing problems with dependencies in the run configuration because the run configuration is created and updated based on the product configuration file.
So always ensure that the product file is correctly configured instead of changing the derived information.
The product configuration is used for the export of your product, hence an error in the product dependencies results in an exported application which cannot be started.
