== Resources and Marker

Eclipse represents Resources like _Projects_, _Files_, _Folders_, _Packages_ as `IResource`.

Marker represent additional information for resources, e.g., an error marker.
Every marker can have attributes (key / value combination).
Markers can be displayed in the standard view, e.g., the _Task_, _Bookmark_ or the _Problems_ view.
To be displayed in these views, you have to use predefined attributes.

The following will demonstrate how to create marker for a selected resource.
