== Adapters
	

=== What are adapters?

Adapters help to display information about objects in view without having to adjust the existing views.
In this example we will create a small view which allows to select objects and use the properties view to display them.

Adapters are used on several places, for example, you can use an adapter to display your data in the outline view.
See http://www.eclipsezone.com/eclipse/forums/t101941.html[Outline View Example for an example] on how to do this.
