=== What are adapters?

Adapters help to display information about objects in view without having to adjust the existing views.
In this example we will create a small view which allows to select objects and use the properties view to display them.

Adapters are used on several places, for example, you can use an adapter to display your data in the outline view.
See http://www.eclipsezone.com/eclipse/forums/t101941.html[Outline View Example for an example] on how to do this.

[[adapters_example]]
=== Example

We will simply use an adapter to show our data in the property view.
Create a new plug-in project _de.vogella.plugin.adapter_.
Use the _Plug-in with a view_ template with the following settings.

Add the dependency _org.eclipse.ui.views_ in tab dependencies of the _MANIFEST.MF_.

Create the following `Todo` class as data model.

[source, java]
----
include::examples/adapter/Todo.java[]
----

Change the code of _SampleView.java_ to the following.
After this change, you should be able to run your project, open your view and see your to-do items.

[source, java]
----
include::examples/adapter/SampleView.java[]
----

To displays its values in the property view, add the extension point _org.eclipse.core.runtime.adapters_ to your project.

The data of the extension point should be like the following.

[source, xml]
----
include::examples/adapter/extension.xml[]
----

Implement the `IPropertySource` interface to provide it for the _Properties_ view.

[source, java]
----
include::examples/adapter/TodoPropertySource.java[]
----

Implement the factory and the new class `TodoPropertySource` which implements `IPropertySource`.

[source, java]
----
include::examples/adapter/TodoAdapterFactory.java[]
----

If you run your workbench and open your view via menu:Windows[Show > View > Others > Sample Category > Sample View] and you select a data element in your viewer you should see your data in the _Properties_ view.
