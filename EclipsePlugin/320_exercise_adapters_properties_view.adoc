== Exercise - Adapters for the Properties view

We will simply use an adapter to show our data in the _Properties_ view.

Create a new plug-in project _de.vogella.plugin.adapter_.

Add the following dependencies in the dependencies tab of the _MANIFEST.MF_ file:

* org.eclipse.core.runtime
* org.eclipse.e4.ui.model.workbench
* org.eclipse.e4.ui.services
* org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench
* org.eclipse.ui
* org.eclipse.ui.views

Create the following `Todo` class as data model.

[source, java]
----
include::res/adapter/Todo.java[]
----

Create a model fragment (_fragment.e4xmi_) and add a _PartDescriptor_ called _Sample View_.

Create _SampleView.java_ as part for the PartDescriptor implementation.

[source, java]
----
include::res/adapter/SampleView.java[]
----

After this change, you should be able to run your project, open your view and see your to-do items.

To display the `Todo` values in the _Properties_ view, add the extension point _org.eclipse.core.runtime.adapters_ to your project.

The data of the extension point should be like the following:

[source, xml]
----
include::res/adapter/extension.xml[]
----

Implement the `IPropertySource` interface to provide it for the _Properties_ view.

[source, java]
----
include::res/adapter/TodoPropertySource.java[]
----

Implement the factory and the new class `TodoPropertySource` which implements `IPropertySource`.

[source, java]
----
include::res/adapter/TodoAdapterFactory.java[]
----

If you run your workbench and open your view via menu:Windows[Show > View > Others > Sample Category > Sample View] and you select a data element in your viewer you should see your data in the _Properties_ view.
