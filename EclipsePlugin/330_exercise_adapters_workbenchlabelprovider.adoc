== Exercise - Adapters and the WorkbenchLabelProvider

The _de.vogella.plugin.adapter_ plug-in from <<adapters_propertyview_example>> should be reused for this exercise.

Create another _PartDescriptor_ called _WorkbenchAdapter Sample_, which also has the _Sample Category_ category.

Create _SampleWorkbenchAdapterView.java_ as part for the PartDescriptor implementation.
The only difference to the previous `SampleView` is that a `DelegatingStyledCellLabelProvider` is used as LabelProvider, which takes the `WorkbenchLabelProvider` as `IStyledLabelProvider` implementation.

When using a `WorkbenchLabelProvider` the objects, which are supposed to be shown in the `Viewer` should provide an adapter for the `IWorkbenchAdapter`, `IWorkbenchAdapter2` and `IWorkbenchAdapter3` interface, but at least for the the `IWorkbenchAdapter`. These interfaces can be used by the `WorkbenchLabelProvider` in order to determine how the objects should be visualized.

To provide these adapters for the `WorkbenchLabelProvider` a `TodoWorkbenchAdapter` is created.
It derives from `WorkbenchAdapter`, which is an abstract class that implements all three interfaces.

include::res/adapter/TodoWorkbenchAdapter.java[]

Now the `TodoAdapterFactory` has to be extended to also provide the `TodoWorkbenchAdapter`.

----
include::res/adapter/TodoAdapterFactoryWorkbenchAdapter.java[]
----

Now that the `TodoAdapterFactory` can also return `WorkbenchAdapter` objects, it also has to be specified in the _org.eclipse.core.runtime.adapters_ extension point.

The result should look similar this:
