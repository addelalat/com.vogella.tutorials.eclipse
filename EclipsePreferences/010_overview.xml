			The Eclipse platform supports
			_preferences_
			for persisting data between application restarts. Preferences are
			stored as
			key / value
			pairs. The key is an
			arbitrary
			String. The value
			can be a
			boolean, String, int or
			another
			primitive type. For
			example the
			_user_
			key may point to the value
			_vogella_
			.
		

		
			The preference support in Eclipse is based on the
			`Preferences`
			class from the
			`org.osgi.service.prefs`
			package. Eclipse
			preferences
			are
			very
			similar to the standard Java
			preferences API but use the
			Eclipse
			framework
			to save and
			retrieve
			the
			configuration and support
			_scopes_
			.
		


		
			The scope defines
			how the
			preference data is stored and how it is
			changeable. The Eclipse runtime defines three scopes
			as
			explained in the following table.

							<entry>Preferences in this scope are specific to a single Eclipse workspace.
								If the user runs start same Eclipse
								application
								for different workspaces, the
								settings
								between the
								applications
								can be different.
							</entry>
						</row>

						<row>
							<entry>Configuration scope</entry>
							<entry>Settings for identical for the same installation.
								Preferences stored in this scope are shared across all
								workspaces.
							</entry>

						</row>
						<row>
							<entry>Default scope</entry>
							<entry>Default values can not be changed.
								This scope is not stored on disk at all but can be used to store
								default
								values for all your keys.
								These preferences
								are supplied via
								configuration files in plug-ins and product
								definitions.
							</entry>
						</row>
						<row>
							<entry>BundleDefaultsScope</entry>
							<entry>
								Similar to the default scope, these values are not written to disk.
								They are read from a
								file, typically named
								_preferences.ini_
								.
							</entry>

=== Storage of the preferences
		
			Eclipse stores the preferences in the workspace of your
			application in
			the
			_.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.core.runtime/.settings/
			_
			directory in the
			_<![CDATA[<nodePath>.prefs]]>_
			file.
		
		
			The <![CDATA[<nodePath>]]>
			is by default the Bundle-SymbolicName of the plug-in but can be
			specified via the preference API.
			The workspace is by
			default the
			directory
			in which the
			application starts.
		
		
			You can configure the storage location of the preferences
			via the
			_-data path_
			launch parameter in Eclipse. To place the preferences in the user
			home directory use the
			_-data @user.home_
			parameter setting.
		
	

=== Eclipse preference API
		
			You can create and manipulate preferences directly via
			Singletons
			provided by the Eclipse runtime. You have the
			`InstanceScope`
			,
			`ConfigurationScope`
			and
			`DefaultScope`
			classes which give access to the corresponding instance via the
			`INSTANCE`
			field.
		

		
			Preference values are read and saved by
			`get()`
			and
			`put()`
			methods. In the
			`get()`
			method you specify a default value in case the key can not be
			found.
			The
			`clear()`
			method removes all preferences and the
			`remove()`
			method allows you
			to delete a selected preference value. Via the
			`flush()`
			method you persist the preferences to the file system.
