== Workspace Location

When starting the Eclipse IDE first of all a workspace location has to be specified.
There are several ways to specify a workspace location in an RCP application as well, which might be more suitable for an end user than having a dialog, which asks for a workspace location.

[NOTE]
====
The default workspace location is the install location of the Eclipse RCP application.

=== Using the osgi.instance.area.default property

The `osgi.instance.area.default` property can be used to declaratively define an alternative workspace location.

The property can be specified in the _config.ini_ file of the RCP application. 

Usually properties of the _config.ini_ file are specified in a product configuration:

[TIP]
====
It is also possible to use variables like `@user.home` as value.
This is especially useful when an enviroment like Citrix is used, where several users might use the same application, but should have a different workspace.
====

=== Setting the workspace location programmatically

Many RCP applications have a login screen at startup and the actual workspace location should be set according to the user being logged in.

In E4 applications a login screen is usually created in a lifecycle class in the method annotated with `@PostContextCreate`.

[CAUTION]
====
The instance location can only be set once! Therefore the if statement with `if(Platform.getInstanceLocation().isSet())` is used.
====

[TIP]
====
When running the RCP application during development from the Eclipse IDE there usually already is a workspace in the run configuration.
To be able to set the location during development the _Location_ field must be empty.
