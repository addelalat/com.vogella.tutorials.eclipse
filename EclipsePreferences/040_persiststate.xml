	<para>
		Eclipse provides the
		<code>@PersistState</code>
		annotation. This annotation can be applied to a method in a class
		referred to a part.
	</para>

	<para>
		Such an annotated method can be used to store the instance state of
		the part.
		The Eclipse
		framework calls such a method whenever the part or
		the application
		closes. The
		stored information can be used in the
		method
		annotated with the
		<code>@PostConstruct</code>
		annotation. A typical use case for such a method would be to store the
		state of
		a checkbox.

	</para>
	<para>The usage of this annotation is demonstrated in the following
		example code.
