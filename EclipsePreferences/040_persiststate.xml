== Persistence of part state


	
		Eclipse provides the
		`@PersistState`
		annotation. This annotation can be applied to a method in a class
		referred to a part.
	

	
		Such an annotated method can be used to store the instance state of
		the part.
		The Eclipse
		framework calls such a method whenever the part or
		the application
		closes. The
		stored information can be used in the
		method
		annotated with the
		`@PostConstruct`
		annotation. A typical use case for such a method would be to store the
		state of
		a checkbox.

	
	The usage of this annotation is demonstrated in the following
		example code.
	
	
		<programlisting language="java">
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
				parse="text" href="./examples/persistsstate/Example.java" />
		</programlisting>
