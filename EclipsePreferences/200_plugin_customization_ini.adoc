== Setting preferences via plugin_customization.ini
(((Preferences,Default values)))
You
can use a file to set the default values of preferences. The file
which
contains these defaults is typically named
_plugin_customization.ini_.

Such a file needs
to
be registered via the
_preferenceCustomization_
property on the product extension point in the
_plugin.xml_
file. This is demonstrated in the following screenshot.

The format to use is
`<plugin id>/<setting>=<value>`
,
e.g.
_com.example.e4.rcp.todo/user=vogella_.

TIP: To find the correct keys, just start your Eclipse application,
switch
to the
_.metadata_
directory in your workspace directory (by
default the directory your
application is starting in) and search for
files ending with
_.pref_.
