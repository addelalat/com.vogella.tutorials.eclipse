== Tutorial: Preferences via code
	
		You can create, store and retrieve preference values directly via
		your
		coding. The following gives an example for this. Create an Eclipse
		composite with three buttons. Use this composite in one of your parts
		(View or Editor).
	
	

		The first
		`Button`
		will set the preference values. The next will display the values and
		the last will clear the preference values.
