== Tutorial: Secure storage of preferences
	
		To test the secure storage of preferences create the project
		_de.vogella.preferences.security_
		with a
		view and add the
		`org.eclipse.equinox.security`
		plug-in as a dependency to
		it.
	

	 Change the code of your view to the following. 

	
		<programlisting>
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
				parse="text" href="./examples/security/View.java" />
		</programlisting>
