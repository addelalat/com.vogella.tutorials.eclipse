== Product configuration file

=== The Product configuration file and the application
		
A
_product configuration file_
(in a shorter form this is called:
_product_
)
defines the configuration of an Eclipse
application. This includes
icons,
splash
screen and the plug-ins (directly or via the usage of
features) which are included in your
application.
		
A
product
always points to one application
class. The default
application for Eclipse RCP applications is
the
`org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench.swt.E4Application`
class which should be sufficient for most scenarios. In case
customers want to adjust the default Eclipse initialization logic
they could also provide their own implementation, such
implementation
must implement the
`IApplication`
interface.
		
A
product is
a development
artifact
and is not
required at
runtime.

=== Creating a new product configuration file
		
A product is typically created in a separate project. In the
_Plug-in Development_
perspective you can create a new
product
configuration file via a
right-click on
a
project and by
selecting
menu:New[Product Configuration]
.

=== Using the product editor
		
You can edit the product file via a special editor. The product
extension and the containing plug-in can be defined in the
_Product Definition_
section.

On the
_Overview_
tab of this editor you can start the product.
Pressing the
_Synchronize_
link writes the relevant
product
configuration
information into the
_plugin.xml_
file. Both settings are highlighted in the following screenshot.

It is possible to enter an ID for the product. Avoid using the
same ID for the product as for a plug-in as
this might create
problems
during a product export. Convention is to add the .product
extension
to
the ID.
		
On the
_Contents_
tab you can define the set of plug-ins or features which are included in the
product,
e.g., the plug-ins that are included if you start or export your product.
	

=== Splash screen

The
_Splash_
tab allows you to specify the plug-in which
contains the splash
screen. The name is predefined as
_splash.bmp_
and it must be located in the root of the plug-in directory.
Therefore, you need to put a file called
_splash.bmp_
file
into the project main
directory. Currently Eclipse supports only
Bitmap (
_.bmp_
)
files.

The predefined name and location of the splash screen image can be
changed via the
_osgi.splashPath_
parameter, the file name can be changed with the
_-showsplash path_to_file_
.

=== Icons, launcher name and program arguments

You can configure the launcher name and icon for your
product. The
launcher is the executable program that is
created during
the
deployment of the product. A launcher is
platform specific. For
example the default launcher is called
_eclipse.exe_
on the
MS Windows platform. This
launcher has also
an
icon associated with
it. To
change the name and the
icon, select
the
_Launching_
tab of
your product
configuration.

Here you can specify the file name of the launcher
and the icon
which should be used.
Make sure the format of the icons is correct,
otherwise
Eclipse will not use them.

TIP:
The icon configuration depends on the platform you are using.
Eclipse allows you to export your application for multiple platforms
and uses the correct ones based on your product configuration.

In the
_Launching Arguments_
section you can specify parameters for your
Eclipse application
and
arguments for the Java runtime environment.
_Program Arguments_
are parameters passed to the Eclipse application.

=== Product configuration limitations

Currently the splash handlers, which can be registered via the
_Customization_
part of the
_Splash_
tab are not supported by the Eclipse 4 standard. Also,
the
configuration
in the
_About Dialog_
and the
_Welcome Page_
section
on the
_Branding_
tab is not directly supported in Eclipse 4 RCP applications.
