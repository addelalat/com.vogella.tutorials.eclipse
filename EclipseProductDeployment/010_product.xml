== Product configuration file

=== The Product configuration file and the application
		
		
		
		
			A
			_product configuration file_
			(in a shorter form this is called:
			_product_
			)
			defines the configuration of an Eclipse
			application. This includes
			icons,
			splash
			screen and the plug-ins (directly or via the usage of
			features) which are included in your
			application.
		
		
			A
			product
			always points to one application
			class. The default
			application for Eclipse RCP applications is
			the
			`org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench.swt.E4Application`
			class which should be sufficient for most scenarios. In case
			customers want to adjust the default Eclipse initialization logic
			they could also provide their own implementation, such
			implementation
			must implement the
			`IApplication`
			interface.
		
		
			A
			product is
			a development
			artifact
			and is not
			required at
			runtime.
		
	

=== Creating a new product configuration file
		
			A product is typically created in a separate project. In the
			_Plug-in Development_
			perspective you can create a new
			product
			configuration file via a
			right-click on
			a
			project and by
			selecting
			menu:New[Product Configuration]
			.
		
	

=== Using the product editor
		
			You can edit the product file via a special editor. The product
			extension and the containing plug-in can be defined in the
			_Product Definition_
			section.

			On the
			_Overview_
			tab of this editor you can start the product.
			Pressing the
			_Synchronize_
			link writes the relevant
			product
			configuration
			information into the
			_plugin.xml_
			file. Both settings are highlighted in the following screenshot.

		It is possible to enter an ID for the product. Avoid using the
			same ID for the product as for a plug-in as
			this might create
			problems
			during a product export. Convention is to add the .product
			extension
			to
			the ID.
		
		
			On the
			_Contents_
			tab you can define the set of plug-ins or features which are included in the
			product,
			e.g., the plug-ins that are included if you start or export your product.
		

	
	

        <title>Splash screen
        <indexterm>
            <primary>Splash screen</primary>
        </indexterm>
        
            The
            _Splash_
            tab allows you to specify the plug-in which
            contains the splash
            screen. The name is predefined as
            _splash.bmp_
            and it must be located in the root of the plug-in directory.
            Therefore, you need to put a file called
            _splash.bmp_
            file
            into the project main
            directory. Currently Eclipse supports only
            Bitmap (
            _.bmp_
            )
            files.

            The predefined name and location of the splash screen image can be
            changed via the
            <parameter class='command'>osgi.splashPath_
            parameter, the file name can be changed with the
            _-showsplash path_to_file_
            . See
            <xref linkend="runconfiguration_product" />
            to learn how to set launch parameters.

            You can configure the launcher name and icon for your
            product. The
            launcher is the executable program that is
            created during
            the
            deployment of the product. A launcher is
            platform specific. For
            example the default launcher is called
            <parameter class='command'>eclipse.exe_
            on the
            MS Windows platform. This
            launcher has also
            an
            icon associated with
            it. To
            change the name and the
            icon, select
            the
            _Launching_
            tab of
            your product
            configuration.
        
         Here you can specify the file name of the launcher
            and the icon
            which should be used.
            Make sure the format of the icons is correct,
            otherwise
            Eclipse will not use them.
        


        <tip>
            The icon configuration depends on the platform you are using.
                Eclipse allows you to export your application for multiple platforms
                and uses the correct ones based on your product configuration.

            In the
            _Launching Arguments_
            section you can specify parameters for your
            Eclipse application
            and
            arguments for the Java runtime environment.
            _Program Arguments_
            are parameters passed to the Eclipse application.

            Currently the splash handlers, which can be registered via the
            _Customization_
            part of the
            _Splash_
            tab are not supported by the Eclipse 4 standard. Also,
            the
            configuration
            in the
            _About Dialog_
            and the

            section
            on the

            tab is not directly supported in Eclipse 4 RCP applications.
