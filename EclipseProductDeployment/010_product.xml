			A

			(in a shorter form this is called:
			<wordasword>product</wordasword>
			)
			defines the configuration of an Eclipse

			icons,

			screen and the plug-ins (directly or via the usage of
			features) which are included in your
			application.

			A
			product
			always points to one application
			class. The default
			application for Eclipse RCP applications is
			the
			<code>org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench.swt.E4Application</code>
			class which should be sufficient for most scenarios. In case
			customers want to adjust the default Eclipse initialization logic
			they could also provide their own implementation, such
			implementation
			must implement the
			<code>IApplication</code>
			interface.

		<para>It is possible to enter an ID for the product. Avoid using the

			the ID.

            and it must be located in the root of the plug-in directory.
            Therefore, you need to put a file called
            <filename>splash.bmp</filename>
            file
            into the project main
            directory. Currently Eclipse supports only

        <para>
            You can configure the launcher name and icon for your
            product. The
            launcher is the executable program that is
            created during
            the
            deployment of the product. A launcher is
            platform specific. For
            example the default launcher is called
            <parameter class='command'>eclipse.exe</parameter>
            on the
            MS Windows platform. This
            launcher has also
            an
            icon associated with
            it. To
            change the name and the
            icon, select
            the
            <guilabel>Launching</guilabel>
            tab of
            your product
            configuration.
        </para>
        <para> Here you can specify the file name of the launcher
            and the icon
            which should be used.
            Make sure the format of the icons is correct,
            otherwise
            Eclipse will not use them.
        </para>


        <tip>
            <para>The icon configuration depends on the platform you are using.
                Eclipse allows you to export your application for multiple platforms
                and uses the correct ones based on your product configuration.
