== Deployment of your application

=== Creating a stand-alone version of the application

An Eclipse application needs to be exported (also called: deployed) to run outside of Eclipse.
Exporting your product creates a folder with all required artifacts to run your application. 
This includes a native launcher specific to the platforms, e.g., Windows or Linux, you have exported it for.

=== Exporting via the product file

Select your product configuration file to export your application.
Select the _Overview_ tab and click on the _Eclipse Product export wizard_ link.
In the wizard you can specify the target directory for the export via the `Directory` property in the _Destination_ group/section. 
The export wizard is depicted in the following screenshot.

The `Root directory` property can be used to specify a sub-folder in the destination which contains the complete exported application.
This is useful, if you export the product as an archive file.

The resulting directory can be shared with others, typically as an archive (zip) file.
The export dialog allows you to create an archive file directl.

If the _Generate p2 repository_ option is selected, an (p2) update site is generated in a _repository_ folder. 
This folder can be used to update the Eclipse RCP application via the p2 API.

If you transfer the content of this directory to another machine (with the same architecture, e.g., Linux 64 bit), your application can start on this machine. 
Of course, the correct Java version must be installed on the target machine.

=== Defining which artifacts are included in the export

The artifacts which are included in an export are defined by the _build.properties_ file of the plug-in.
Eclipse provides an graphical editor for this file.

Eclipse adds the compiled Java classes by default. 
Other files must be added manually, e.g., icons or splash screen images.

An Eclipse application started from the Eclipse IDE has access to all resources available in the IDE.
But to make them available in the exported application you need to select them in the _build.properties_ file.

It is good practice to include new required resources immediately in the _build.properties_ file. 
This avoids errors after the export of your application.

=== Mandatory plug-in artifacts in build.properties 

Make sure the following items (if available) are included in each plug-in of the exported application::

* META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
* plugin.xml
* other static files, e.g., icons, splash.bmp, etc.
* Application.e4xmi
* CSS files
* OSGi service definition files
* model fragments
* translation files

The screenshot below shows the _build.properties_ file for a plug-in with most of these components.

=== Common product export problems

==== Problems with the export and log files

During the export or the start of the exported application you may encounter problems. 
If your application got successfully exported but cannot be started you find a log file ending with the _.log_ extension in the _configuration_ folder of your application. 
This file contains the error you encountered.

Alternatively the export process may fail. 
In both cases you can use this chapter as reference to try to find and fix the reason for the failure.

==== Export problem number #1: export folder is not empty

The most common problem is that the folder to which you export is not empty.
If you export to a certain folder, ensure that the folder is empty. 
Exporting twice to the same folder may create file locks or results in error messages reporting version conflicts.

==== Checklist for common export problems

If the export encounters a problem please have a look into the following table for a solution:

.Problems with the product export
[cols="1,2",options="header"]
|===
|Problem |Possible cause

|Export fails
|Try using an empty target directory, sometimes
the export
cannot delete the existing files and therefore fails.

|No executable file after the export
|Check the flag "The product
includes native
launcher
artifacts" in
your .product file on the
_Overview_
tab.

|Product could not be found
|Validate that all dependencies
are included in the product.
Delete an existing launch
configuration and restart the product
from the IDE to see if
everything is configured correctly.

|Splash screen or other icons are missing
|Check the
_build.properties_
file to see if all required images and
icons are
included in
the
export.

|Splash screen is missing
|Ensure that you have entered the defining plug-in in the
"Splash" tab on the product configuration file. If this is not
set, the splash screen is not displayed after the export.
Unfortunately, it is displayed if you start the plug-in
from the
Eclipse IDE.

|Issues during start of the application
|Check the log file in the
workspace folder of your exported
application to see the error messages
during the start process.
Alternatively
add the
"-consoleLog" parameter to the ".ini" file
in folder
of
the
exported application.

|applicationXMI argument is missing
|Check the
_build.properties_
file to see if the
_Application.e4xmi_
and
the
_plugin.xml_
files are
included in
the export.

|Service could not be found or injected
|Make sure that the bundle which provides the service has the
_Activate this plug-in when one of its classes is
loaded
_
flag set. Also
make
sure
that the
`org.eclipse.equinox.ds`
bundle
is started automatically with a
_Start Level_
less than 4.

|Application ID could not be found
|Define a
start
level of 1 and set auto-start to true for the
`org.eclipse.core.runtime`
plug-in.

|Translations not available in the exported product
|Ensure via the
_build.properties_
file of the relevant plug-in that the files containing the
translations are included in
the export.

=== Export for multiple platforms via the delta pack

The _delta pack_ contains the platform specific features and plug-ins which are required to build and export Eclipse applications for multiple platforms.
It also includes binary launchers for all platforms in the `org.eclipse.equinox.executable` feature.

See https://wiki.eclipse.org/Building#Cross-platform_build[Wiki entry for Cross-platform builds] for the usage. 


=== Including the required JRE into the export
        
You can also deploy your own RCP application bundled with a JRE
to
make
sure that
a
certain JRE is used. An Eclipse application first
searches in
the
installation directory for a folder called
`jre`
and for a
contained
Java-VM.
If it finds one, then this JRE is used to
start the
Eclipse
application.
        
To include the JRE from your running environment, select the
_Bundle JRE for this environment with the product_
flag on the
_Launching_
tab of your product configuration file.

=== Headless build
        
A _headless build_ is an automatic build without user interaction and without a graphical user interface. 
It can be triggered from the command line.
Typically, the build is automatically done via an additional software component called the _build server_ which does so in a clean (and remote) environment.
        
Different solutions exist to do a headless build.
Currently the most popular approach for building Eclipse RCP applications is based on Maven Tycho.
Describing a headless build is beyond the scope of this description but you can see the online http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseTycho/article.html[Maven Tycho tutorial] for an introduction into headless builds for Eclipse RCP applications.
        
An example for a build server would be the _Jenkins_ continuous integration (system). 
See the online http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/Jenkins/article.html[Jenkins tutorial] for an introduction into the setup, configuration and usage of Jenkins.
