== Deployment of your application

=== Creating a stand-alone version of the application

An Eclipse application needs to be exported (also called: deployed) to run outside of Eclipse.
Exporting your product creates a folder with all required artifacts to run your application. 
This includes a native launcher specific to the platforms, e.g., Windows or Linux, you have exported it for.

=== Exporting via the product file

Select your product configuration file to export your application.
Select the _Overview_ tab and click on the _Eclipse Product export wizard_ link.
In the wizard you can specify the target directory for the export via the `Directory` property in the _Destination_ group/section. 
The export wizard is depicted in the following screenshot.

The `Root directory` property can be used to specify a sub-folder in the destination which contains the complete exported application.
This is useful, if you export the product as an archive file.

The resulting directory can be shared with others, typically as an archive (zip) file.
The export dialog allows you to create an archive file directl.

If the _Generate p2 repository_ option is selected, an (p2) update site is generated in a _repository_ folder. 
This folder can be used to update the Eclipse RCP application via the p2 API.

If you transfer the content of this directory to another machine (with the same architecture, e.g., Linux 64 bit), your application can start on this machine. 
Of course, the correct Java version must be installed on the target machine.

=== Defining which artifacts are included in the export

The artifacts which are included in an export are defined by the _build.properties_ file of the plug-in.
Eclipse provides an graphical editor for this file.

Eclipse adds the compiled Java classes by default. 
Other files must be added manually, e.g., icons or splash screen images.

An Eclipse application started from the Eclipse IDE has access to all resources available in the IDE.
But to make them available in the exported application you need to select them in the _build.properties_ file.

It is good practice to include new required resources immediately in the _build.properties_ file. 
This avoids errors after the export of your application.

=== Mandatory plug-in artifacts in build.properties 

Make sure the following items (if available) are included in each plug-in of the exported application::

* META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
* plugin.xml
* other static files, e.g., icons, splash.bmp, etc.
* Application.e4xmi
* CSS files
* OSGi service definition files
* model fragments
* translation files

The screenshot below shows the _build.properties_ file for a plug-in with most of these components.

=== Export for multiple platforms via the delta pack

The _delta pack_ contains the platform specific features and plug-ins which are required to build and export Eclipse applications for multiple platforms.
It also includes binary launchers for all platforms in the `org.eclipse.equinox.executable` feature.

See https://wiki.eclipse.org/Building#Cross-platform_build[Wiki entry for Cross-platform builds] for the usage. 


=== Including the required JRE into the export
        
You can also deploy your own RCP application bundled with a JRE
to
make
sure that
a
certain JRE is used. An Eclipse application first
searches in
the
installation directory for a folder called
`jre`
and for a
contained
Java-VM.
If it finds one, then this JRE is used to
start the
Eclipse
application.
        
To include the JRE from your running environment, select the
_Bundle JRE for this environment with the product_
flag on the
_Launching_
tab of your product configuration file.

=== Headless build
        
A
_headless build_
is an automatic build without user interaction and without a
graphical user interface. It can be triggered from the command line.
Typically, the build is automatically done via an additional software
component called the
_build server_
which does so in a clean (and remote) environment.
        
Different solutions exist to do a
headless build.
Currently the most
popular
approach for building Eclipse RCP applications is based on
Maven Tycho. Describing a headless build is beyond the scope of this
description but you can see the online
http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseTycho/article.html[Maven Tycho tutorial]
for an introduction into headless builds for Eclipse RCP
applications.
        
An example for a build server would be the
_Jenkins_
continuous integration (system). See the online
http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/Jenkins/article.html[Jenkins tutorial]
for an introduction into the setup, configuration and usage of
Jenkins.
