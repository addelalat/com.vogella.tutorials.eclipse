== Deployment of your application

=== Creating a stand-alone version of the application
		<indexterm>
			<primary>Export</primary>
			<see>Deployment</see>
		</indexterm>
		
		An Eclipse application needs to be exported (also called:
			deployed) to run outside of Eclipse.
			Your product configuration file
			can be used for that purpose.
			Exporting
			your product creates
			a folder
			with all
			required
			artifacts
			to run your
			application. This
			includes
			a
			native
			launcher
			specific to
			the
			platforms,
			e.g., Windows
			or
			Linux, you
			have
			exported it
			for.
		
	

=== Exporting via the product file
		
			To export the product switch to your product configuration file,
			select the
			_Overview_
			tab and click on the
			_Eclipse Product export wizard_
			link.
			In the wizard you can specify the location of the exported
			product via
			the
			<filename class="directory">Directory_
			property in the
			_Destination_
			group/section. The export wizard is depicted in the following
			screenshot.

			The
			<property>Root directory</property>
			property can be used to specify a sub-folder
			in the destination which
			contains the complete exported application.
			This is useful if you
			export the product as an archive file.
		
		
			The
			resulting directory can be, for example, compressed (zipped)
			and
			shared
			with others. The
			export dialog
			allows you to create an archive
			file
			directly,
			which makes
			it easier to
			transfer all files to another
			machine.
		
		
			If the
			_Generate p2 repository_
			option is selected, an (p2) update site is generated in a folder
			called
			_repository_
			. This folder can be used to update the Eclipse RCP application.
		
		
			If you transfer the content of this directory to another machine
			(with the same architecture, e.g., Linux 64 bit),
			your application
			can
			start on this machine. Of course the correct Java version must be
			installed there.
		
	


=== Defining which artifacts are included in the export
		
		
			The artifacts which are included in an export are
			defined by
			the
			_build.properties_
			file of the plug-in. Eclipse provides an graphical editor for this
			file.
		
		
			Eclipse adds the
			compiled Java
			classes by default. You have
			to
			add
			other
			files manually, e.g.,
			icons or splash screen images.
		
		
			An Eclipse application started
			from
			the Eclipse IDE
			has access to all
			resources available in the IDE. But to make them available in the
			exported application you need to select them
			in the
			_build.properties_
			file.
		
		
			It is good practice to include new required resources immediately in
			the
			_build.properties_
			file. This avoids errors after the export of your
			application.
		
	

=== Mandatory plug-in artifacts in build.properties 
		
			Make sure the following items (if available) are included in each
			plug-in of the exported application::
			<itemizedlist>
				*
					META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
				
				*
					plugin.xml
				
				*
					
						other
						static
						files, e.g., icons,
						splash.bmp, etc.
					
				
				*
					Application.e4xmi
				
				*
					CSS files
				
				*
					OSGi service definition files
				
				*
					model fragments
				
				*
					translation files
				
			
		

		
			The screenshot below shows
			_build.properties_
			file for a plug-in with most of these components.

=== Export for multiple platforms via the delta pack
		<indexterm>
			<primary>Deployment</primary>
			<secondary>Multiple platforms</secondary>
		</indexterm>
		
		
			The
			_delta pack_
			contains the platform specific features and
			plug-ins
			which are
			required
			to build and export
			Eclipse applications for
			multiple
			platforms.
			It also
			includes binary launchers
			for all platforms
			in the
			`org.eclipse.equinox.executable`
			feature.
		
		
			See
			https://wiki.eclipse.org/Building#Cross-platform_build">Wiki entry for Cross-platform builds
			for the usage. It basically requires that you add the delta pack
			update site to your target platform via
			the
			menu:Window[Preferences > Plug-in Development > Target Platform]
			menu entry.
