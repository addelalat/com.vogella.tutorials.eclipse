			You can also deploy your own RCP application bundled with a JRE
			to
			make
			sure that
			a
			certain JRE is used. An Eclipse application first
			searches in
			the
			installation directory for a folder called
			<filename class="directory">jre</filename>
			and for a
			contained
			Java-VM.
			If it finds one, then this JRE is used to
			start the
			Eclipse
			application.
		</para>
		<para>
			To include the JRE from your running environment, select the
			<guilabel>Bundle JRE for this environment with the product</guilabel>
			flag on the
			<guilabel>Launching</guilabel>
			tab of your product configuration file.

		<para>
			A
			<wordasword>headless build</wordasword>
			is an automatic build without user interaction and without a
			graphical user interface. It can be triggered from the command line.
			Typically, the build is automatically done via an additional software
			component called the
			<wordasword>build server</wordasword>
			which does so in a clean (and remote) environment.
		</para>
		<para>
			Different solutions exist to do a
			headless build.
			Currently the most
			popular
			approach for building Eclipse RCP applications is based on
			Maven Tycho. Describing a headless build is beyond the scope of this
			description but you can see the online
			<ulink url="http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseTycho/article.html">Maven Tycho tutorial</ulink>
			for an introduction into headless builds for Eclipse RCP
			applications.
		</para>
		<para>
			An example for a build server would be the
			<wordasword>Jenkins</wordasword>
			continuous integration (system). See the online
			<ulink url="http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/Jenkins/article.html">Jenkins tutorial</ulink>
			for an introduction into the setup, configuration and usage of
			Jenkins.
