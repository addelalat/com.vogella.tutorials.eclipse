			During the export or the start of the exported application you may
			encounter
			problems. If your application got successfully exported but
			cannot be started you find
			a log file
			ending with the
			<filename>.log</filename>
			extension in the
			<filename>configuration</filename>
			folder of your application. This file contains the error you
			encountered.
		</para>
		<para>Alternatively the export process may fail. In both cases you can
			use
			this chapter as reference to try to find and fix the reason for
			the failure.

		<title>Export problem number #1: export folder is not empty</title>
		<para>
			The most common problem is that the folder to which you export
			is not
			empty.
			If you export to a certain folder, ensure that the
			folder
			is empty. Exporting twice to the same folder may create file locks
			or
			results in error messages reporting version conflicts.
