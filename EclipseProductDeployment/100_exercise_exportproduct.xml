	<title>Exercise: Export your product
[[tutorial_exportproduct1">
=== Export your product
		
			Use the
			product
			file of your
			<code>com.example.e4.rcp.wizard</code>
			plug-in to export your Eclipse application.

			Enter a new directory in the
			_Directory_
			field. If in doubt use the
			_Browse_
			button to find a valid directory. The following screenshot shows an
			example under Ubuntu.

						dialog,pdfwidth=60%]
		
		
			Press the
			_Finish_
			button to start the export.
		
		<warning>
			The exported directory should be empty. If you export twice to
				the same directory, delete its content, otherwise the export fails
				with a dependency conflict. 
		</warning>
	
[[tutorial_exportproduct_validate">
=== Validate that the exported application starts

		
			After the export finishes check the
			<filename class="directory">Root directory</filename>
			folder in the
			<filename class="directory">Directory</filename>
			folder.
		

		
			A
			double-click on the
			native
			launcher starts your
			application.
			Ensure that you can start the application from your exported
			directory.
		
		
			If you face issues during the product export, check the list of
			common export problems from
			<xref linkend="exportproblems" />
			and try to solve
			the
			problem.
		
	
[[exercise_splash">
=== Using a static splash screen
		
			Add a splash screen to your application. For this create or download
			a
			<filename>splash.bmp</filename>
			bitmap file. You find an example under the following URL:
			http://download.vogella.com/resources/splash.bmp">Example splash screen
			.
		

		
			Add the
			<filename>splash.bmp</filename>
			file to the main directory of your
			application. You can copy and paste
			it into the
			_Package Explorer_
			view.
			If you add files outside
			of the Eclipse IDE, you need to
			_Refresh_
			(via F5)
			your project in the
			_Package Explorer_
			view, to see the file in Eclipse.
		

		
			Afterwards, your project should look like the following
			screenshot.

		<warning>
			
				The file name and the location of the file must be correct,
				otherwise
				Eclipse
				will not use your splash screen.
			
		</warning>
		
			On the
			_Splash_
			tab of your product configuration file, define that your application
			plug-in
			contains the splash
			screen.

			Start your application from the Eclipse IDE and verify that the
			splash is displayed.
		
	

[[exercise_splashexport">
=== Include the splash screen into the exported application
		
			Configure that the
			<filename>splash.bmp</filename>
			file is included into the exported application by adding it to the
			<filename>build.properties</filename>
			file of your application plug-in.

					<phrase>Add splash to build properties,pdfwidth=60%]
		

		
			Export your product again and ensure that
			the splash screen is
			also shown if you start the exported application.
		
		<warning>
			
				Make sure that the
				target directory of the export is empty before you
				start the export. See
				<xref linkend="exportproblems" />
				for details.
			
		</warning>
	

[[exercise_launcher">
=== Change launcher name
		
			The Eclipse export wizards uses
			_eclipse_
			as default for your application launcher name,
			e.g., on MS Windows
			this
			results in an
			_eclipse.exe_
			launcher file.
		
		
			Change this launcher name to
			_mywizard_
			on the
			_Launching_
			tab of your product configuration file.
		
		
image::tutorialexport_e4_40.png"
						scale="40" />
				</imageobject>
				<textobject>
					<phrase>Change launcher name,pdfwidth=60%]
		
		
			Export your application via the product file again and validate
			that the launcher name
			has changed. Ensure that the directory you export to is empty before the export.
