Ensure that you have the four features from the screenshot included in your product.

=== Start the application via the product

Start your application via the product configuration file and ensure that the application starts correctly.

====
If the application does not start, check:

* that you have included all four features
* that you start your application via the product configuration and NOT with an existing launch
configuration. This ensures that your new product configuration is used.
