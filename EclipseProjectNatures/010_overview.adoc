== Project Natures in Eclipse

Project Natures are used in the Eclipse IDE in order to configure projects in the
workspace.
One project may consist of several project natures. The most popular project nature is
`org.eclipse.jdt.core.javanature`, which is used to specify the project as
Java project.
Some examples for project natures are:

If your Eclipse installation offers some additional project natures, which can be applied
to a project, you usually can convert the project via context menu.

NOTE: The Configure menu is only visible, if there are project
natures, which can be applied. Otherwise it is not shown at all.
