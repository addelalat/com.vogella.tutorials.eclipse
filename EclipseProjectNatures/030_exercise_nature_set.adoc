== Exercise: Apply a project nature to a project

=== Target

Add a _Convert to example project_ menu item to the Configure menu of a projects context menu.

=== Define an example project nature

Create a plugin project and add the following dependencies to it:

* org.eclipse.core.runtime
* org.eclipse.core.resources
* org.eclipse.ui.ide
* org.eclipse.ui

In the plugin.xml you need to add the `org.eclipse.core.resources.natures`
extension point.

In the _ExampleProjectNature(run)_ we reference the
`ExampleProjectNature` class:

[source,java]
----
include::res/ExampleProjectNature.java[]
----

=== Add a convert command

Now use the `org.eclipse.ui.commands` extension point and add a command
with `com.example.product.examplenature.command`  as
_id_ and `Convert to Example Project` as
_name_.

=== Add a convert handler

Add the `org.eclipse.ui.handlers` extension point and add a handler for the
`com.example.product.examplenature.command` command. The class for the
handler is `ExampleProjectNatureHandler` and looks like this:

[source,java]
----
include::res/ExampleProjectNatureHandler.java[]
----

=== Add the menu contribution for the conversion

The id of the _Configure_ menu in a projects context menu is
`org.eclipse.ui.projectConfigure` and therefore the
_locationURI_ of the _menuContribution_
must be `popup:org.eclipse.ui.projectConfigure`. In this
_menuContribution_ we then reference the defined
command.

[[optional_project_nature_definition]]
=== Optional - Add a core expression

As already mentioned the _Configure_ menu is only visible, in case
it has elements in it, we should only apply the _menuContribution_
to it, if the nature has not already been set.
Therefore we want to add a core expression with the
`org.eclipse.core.expressions.definitions` extension point.

The _id_ of the definition should be
`com.example.project.hasNature`, which adapts
`org.eclipse.core.resources.IProject` as _type_ and
reuses a predefined `PropertyTester`, which is able to check for certain
project natures. The _property_ of the `PropertyTester`
is `org.eclipse.core.resources.projectNature`.

Now we only need to reference this definition in a _visibleWhen_
definition for the _menuContribution_.

Do not forget to define _(not)_ and then reference the
`com.example.project.hasNature` definition. The
_(not)_ is not directly part of the definition itself, because
we want to reuse this definition later on, where we want to ensure that the
`com.example.project.examplenature` is applied to a project.

=== Validate

Start your plug-in within the Eclipse IDE and create a new _General
Project_ and then right click the project and click on menu:Configure[Convert to Example Project]. 
In case you have done the optional part, the
_Convert to Example Project_  menu item should not appear
any more in the _Configure_ menu.
