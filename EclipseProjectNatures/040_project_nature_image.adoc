== Provide an image as decorator for the project

You may have noticed the _J_ as decorator for a java project.

In order to provide such an decorator image in case your project nature has been applied
to a project, you can use the `org.eclipse.ui.ide.projectNatureImages` extension
point.

So in case the `com.example.project.examplenature` project nature is applied to
a project, this decorator will also be shown.

NOTE: The size of the image 8x8 is recommended in order to look nice.

When the `com.example.project.examplenature` is applied to a general
_test_ project it should look like this:
