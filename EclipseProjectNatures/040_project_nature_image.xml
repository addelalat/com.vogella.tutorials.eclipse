== Provide an image as decorator for the project
    You may have noticed the _J_ as decorator for a java project.
    
        <mediaobject>
            <imageobject>
                <imagedata fileref="images/project_nature_java_images.png"/>
            </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
    
    In order to provide such an decorator image in case your project nature has been applied
        to a project, you can use the `org.eclipse.ui.ide.projectNatureImages` extension
        point.
    
        <mediaobject>
            <imageobject>
                <imagedata fileref="images/project_nature_images_extension_point.png"/>
            </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
    
    So in case the `com.example.project.examplenature` project nature is applied to
        a project, this decorator will also be shown.
    
        NOTE:
            The size of the image 8x8 is recommended in order to look nice.
        </note>
    
    When the `com.example.project.examplenature` is applied to a general
            _test_ project it should look like this:
    
        <mediaobject>
            <imageobject>
                <imagedata fileref="images/project_nature_image_example.png"/>
            </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
