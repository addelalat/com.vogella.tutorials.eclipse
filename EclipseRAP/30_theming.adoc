== Theming

=== Overview

A Eclipse RAP application look similar to a Eclipse RCP
application running in a browser. While this is cool, it is not
necessary always what you want if you develop a web application.

 Eclipse RAP therefore provides the possibility to change the
look of the application via theming. Themes can be defined in css
like
files. The following will give an demonstration how to do this.

=== Example

Create a new Eclipse RAP project "de.vogella.rap.theming". Use
the "RAP Mail Template" as template.  
Create a new folder "themes" in your project. 

Add the directory themes to your build.properties. Otherwise
the files from themes will not get included in an exported product.

Add the extension point "org.eclipse.rap.ui.themes". Use the
following settings.

Create now the following file "theme.css" in the folder themes.

[source,text]
----
include::res/themes/theme.css[]
----

Add now the "org.eclipse.rap.ui.branding" extension point which
the following settings. Important is the servletName "rap" as this is
used in your runtime configuration, your entrypoint and the theme you
want to use.
