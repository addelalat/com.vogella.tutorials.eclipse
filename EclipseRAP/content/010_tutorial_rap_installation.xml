	<title>Tutorial: Eclipse RAP installation

	 The following assumes that you have already downloaded and
		installed "Eclipse for RCP and RAP developer". Via the Help page you
		can install the target platform. Select Help -> Welcome from the menu.
		Now the Help page should be diplayed. Click on the overview button and
		search for "RAP" on the next page. Select it and select "Install
		Target Platform". I suggest to select the "Latest release"

	 Use the Eclipse update manager to install the tooling from the
		Eclipse update.
