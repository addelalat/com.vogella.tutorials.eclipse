=== Create Project
		
			Create a new plug-in project "de.vogella.rap.first" via File ->
			New -> Project -> Plug-in Development -> Plug-in Project. Perform the
			following selection.

		Congratulations! You have your first Eclipse RAP application
			running. 


	



=== Entrypoint
		 Eclipse RAP requires an entrypoint similar to
			"org.eclipse.core.runtime.applications" for Eclipse RCP applications.
			The entrypoint for Eclipse RAP is defined via
			"org.eclipse.rap.ui.workbench.entrypoint". 
		

		 View your Entrypoint via the entension
			"org.eclipse.rap.ui.workbench.entrypoint" in the file _MANIFEST.MF_
			.
			Please note that the parameter
			"default" is used in your runtime
			configuration of RAP. 
		.

	
	


=== Extending your UI
		
			Create now a view.
			Select therefore in MANIFEST.MF the tab extension
			and add the extension
			point "org.eclipse.ui.views". Add then add the
			view with the id
			"de.vogella.rap.first.View". The procedure is the
			same as for Eclipse
			RCP application which is described in 
http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/RichClientPlatform/article.html#views"> Adding views to Eclipse RCP applications
			.
		

		 Create the following view class. 
		
[source,text]
----
include::res/firstrap/View.java[]
----
		
		 Add the view to the perspective by changing Perspective.java to
			the following. 
		
[source,text]
----
include::res/firstrap/Perspective.java[]
----
		
		 Run your application and see your new view in actions.

		
			Eclipse RAP supports most of the API JFace and Eclipse RCP support.
			If
			you want
			to learn how you can extend your Eclipse RAP application
			you can review
http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/RichClientPlatform/article.html"> Eclipse RCP Tutorial
			or
http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseJFaceTable/article.html"> Eclipse JFace TableViewer
		
		 Of course Eclipse RAP does only support a subset of these API
			(but this is
			increasing every release)
			so the best way of exploring it
			is to build your application and see
			which API are available.
