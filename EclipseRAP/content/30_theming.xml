[[theming_overview">
=== Overview
		A Eclipse RAP application look similar to a Eclipse RCP
			application running in a browser. While this is cool, it is not
			necessary always what you want if you develop a web application.
		
		 Eclipse RAP therefore provides the possibility to change the
			look of the application via theming. Themes can be defined in css
			like
			files. The following will give an demonstration how to do this.
		
	
[[theming_example">
=== Example
		Create a new Eclipse RAP project "de.vogella.rap.theming". Use
			the "RAP Mail Template" as template.  
		 Create a new folder "themes" in your project. 

		 Add the directory themes to your build.properties. Otherwise
			the files from themes will not get included in an exported product.

		 Add the extension point "org.eclipse.rap.ui.themes". Use the
			following settings. 

		
image::theming10.gif" />
					
				</imageobject>
			</mediaobject>
		

		 Create now the following file "theme.css" in the folder themes.
		

		
			<programlisting>
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="../examples/themes/theme.css" />
			</programlisting>
		

		 Add now the "org.eclipse.rap.ui.branding" extension point which
			the following settings. Important is the servletName "rap" as this is
			used in your runtime configuration, your entrypoint and the theme you
			want to use.

				</imageobject>
			</mediaobject>
		

		 This will result in the following rap application display.
