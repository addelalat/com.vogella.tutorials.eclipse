== Single Sourcing
	
		With Eclipse RAP it is possible to develop a desktop application
http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/RichClientPlatform/article.html"> Eclipse RCP
		and a web application with the same source code. This is called single
		sourcing.
	
	 To use the same code basis for Eclipse RCP and Eclipse RAP you
		can use OSGi fragments. Fragments are special OSGi bundles, which
		extend another bundle and are merged at runtime with the extended
		bundle. You can put the RCP or RAP specific functionality into a
		fragment. If you create a RAP application you use the RAP fragment or
		if you want to create a RCP application you use the RCP fragment.
	
	
		One difference between RCP and RAP is that in RCP you only have
		one
		user. In case you are using singletons which should be user
		specific
		then you have to use the RAP class SessionSingleBase. In case
		you have
		a real singleton for several users you need to consider
		http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/JavaConcurrency/article.html">concurrency
		issues. JFace
		Preference are already correctly supported in
		RAP.
