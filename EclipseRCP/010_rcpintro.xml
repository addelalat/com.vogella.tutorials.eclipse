		<title>What are Eclipse RCP applications?</title>
		<para> Eclipse was originally started as a modular IDE application.
		</para>
		<para>
			In
			2004 Eclipse version 3.0 was released. The Eclipse 3.0 release
			supported
			reusing
			of the
			Eclipse platform to build stand-alone
			applications
			based
			on
			the
			same technology as the Eclipse IDE.
		</para>
		<para>
			At this point the term
			<wordasword>Eclipse RCP</wordasword>
			was
			coined. Eclipse RCP is
			short for
			<wordasword>Eclipse Rich Client Platform</wordasword>
			and indicates that the
			Eclipse platform is used as a basis
			to create
			feature-rich stand-alone
			applications.
		</para>
		<para> The release of Eclipse in version 4.x simplified and unified
			the
			Eclipse
			programming model which is now based on state of the art
			technologies, like a logical model for the application date,
			dependency
			injection as primary programming model
			and
			declarative
			styling via
			CSS
			files. The Eclipse 4 release also supports that the
			user interface technology is replaced, for example you can exchange
			the
			SWT toolkit with JavaFX or GWT.

		<title>Advantages of Eclipse based applications</title>
		<para> The Eclipse platform forms the basis of the most successful
			Java
			IDE and
			therefore is very stable and broadly used. It uses native
			user
			interface
			components which are fast and reliable. It has a
			strong
			modular approach it allows developers to design
			component
			based
			systems.
		</para>
		<para>
			Companies such as IBM, SAP and Google use the Eclipse framework
			as a basis for
			their
			products and therefore ensure that Eclipse is
			flexible, fast
			and
			continues to evolve.
		</para>
		<para>The Eclipse platform also fosters a large community of
			individuals which
			provide support, information and extensions to the
			Eclipse framework.
			Tapping into this ecosystem allows you to find
			required
			resources and information.
