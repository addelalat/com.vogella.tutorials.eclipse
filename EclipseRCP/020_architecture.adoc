== The Architecture of Eclipse

=== Architecture of Eclipse based applications

An Eclipse RCP application consists of individual software components.
Eclipse applications are based on some basic components, other components use them and provided extended functionality on top of them.

The Eclipse IDE can be viewed as a special Eclipse application with the focus on supporting software development.
For example, the Java development tools (JDT) provide the functionality to develop Java applications.

An Eclipse RCP application typically uses the same base components as the Eclipse IDE.
On top of these, they add application specific components as depicted in the following graphic.

=== Core components of the Eclipse platform

_OSGi_ is a specification to describe a modular approach to develop component-based Java applications.
The programming model of OSGi allows you to define dynamic software components, i.e., OSGi services.
_Equinox_ is one implementation of the OSGi specification and is used by the Eclipse platform as its runtime.
This Equinox runtime provides the necessary API's and framework to run a modular Eclipse application.

_SWT_ is the standard user interface component library used by Eclipse.
_JFace_ provides some convenient APIs on top of SWT.
The _workbench_ provides the framework for the application.
It is responsible for displaying all other user interface components.

_EMF_ is the Eclipse Modeling Framework which provides functionality to model a data model and to use this data model at runtime.

=== Eclipse API and internal API
(((Provisional API, Internal API)))
An OSGi runtime allows the developer to mark Java packages as public, provisional or internal APIs.
The internal API is private, therefore not visible. The provisional API are to test non-finalized APIs, therefore are visible but non-stable.
The public API, or simply API, are the visible and stable API, that can be reused by other components.

The Eclipse platform project marks packages either as public API or as provisional API, to make all Java classes accessible to Eclipse developers.
If the Eclipse platform project releases an API, the platform project plans to keep this API stable for as long as possible.

If API is internal but accessible, i.e., marked as provisional, the platform team can change this API in the future.
If you use such API, you must be prepared that you might have to make some adjustments to your application in a future Eclipse release.

If you use unreleased API, you see a _Discouraged access: The ...is not API (restriction on required project ...)_ warning in the Java editor.


[TIP]
====
You can turn off these warnings for your workspace via menu:Window[Preferences > Java > Compiler > Errors/Warnings] and by setting the _Discouraged reference (access rules)_ flag to _Ignore_.

Alternatively you can turn off these warnings on a per project basis, via right-click on the project menu:Properties[Java Compiler] and afterwards use the same path as for accessing the global settings.
You might have to activate the _Enable project specific settings_ checkbox at the top of the Error/Warnings preference page.

=== Important configuration files for Eclipse plug-ins

An Eclipse plug-in has the following main configuration files.
These files are defining the API, and the dependencies of the plug-in.

* _MANIFEST.MF_ - contains the OSGi configuration information.
* _plugin.xml_ - optional configuration file, contains information about Eclipse specific extension mechanisms.

An Eclipse plug-in defines its meta data, like its unique identifier, its exported API and its dependencies via the _MANIFEST.MF_ file.

The _plugin.xml_ file provides the possibility to create and contribute to Eclipse specific API.
You can add _extension points_ and _extensions_ in this file.
_Extension-points_ define interfaces for other plug-ins to contribute functionality.
_Extensions_ contribute functionality to these interfaces. Functionality can be code and non-code based. For example a plug-in might contain help content.
