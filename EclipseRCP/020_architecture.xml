			<wordasword>OSGi</wordasword>
			is a specification to describe a modular approach to develop component-based Java applications. The programming model

			OSGi
			services.
			<wordasword>Equinox</wordasword>
			is
			one
			implementation of the OSGi specification and is used
			by the
			Eclipse
			platform as its runtime. This
			Equinox
			runtime
			provides the
			necessary API's and
			framework to
			run a modular
			Eclipse
			application.
		</para>
		<para>
			<wordasword>SWT</wordasword>
			is the standard user interface component library used by

			<wordasword>JFace</wordasword>
			provides some convenient APIs on top of SWT. The

		<para>
			An OSGi runtime allows the developer to mark Java packages as public, provisional or internal APIs. The internal
			API is private, therefore not visible. The provisional API are to test non-finalized APIs, therefore are visible but
			non-stable. The public API, or simply API, are the visible and stable API, that can be reused by other components.

		</para>


		<para>The Eclipse platform project marks packages either as public API
			or as provisional API, to make all Java classes
			accessible
			to Eclipse
			developers. If the Eclipse platform project releases an
			API, the
			platform project plans to keep
			this API stable for as long
			as
			possible.
		</para>
		<para>
			If API is internal but accessible, i.e., marked as provisional,
			the
			platform team can change this API in the
			future.
			If you use
			such
			API,
			you must be
			prepared that you might have to
			make some
			adjustments to
			your
			application in a future
			Eclipse release.
		</para>
		<para>
			If you use unreleased API, you see a

		</para>

		<para>
			An Eclipse plug-in defines its meta data, like its unique identifier, its exported API and its dependencies via the
			<filename>MANIFEST.MF</filename>
			file.
		</para>
		<para>
			The
			<filename>plugin.xml</filename>
			file provides the possibility to create and contribute to
			Eclipse
			specific
			API. You can add
			<wordasword>extension points</wordasword>
			and
			<wordasword>extensions</wordasword>
			in this file.
			<wordasword>Extension-points</wordasword>
			define interfaces for other
			plug-ins to contribute functionality.
			<wordasword>Extensions</wordasword>
			contribute
			functionality to these interfaces. Functionality can be
			code
			and non-code based. For example a plug-in might
			contain help
			content.
