== Parts

Parts are user interface components which allow you to navigate and modify data.
Parts can be stacked or positioned next to each other depending on the container into which they are dropped.
A part can have a drop-down menu, context menus and a toolbar.

Parts can be classified as _views_ and _editors_.

A view is typically used to work on a set of data, which might be a hierarchical structure.
If data is changed via the view, this change is typically directly applied to the underlying data structure.
A view sometimes allows the user to open an editor for the selected set of data.
For example, the _Package Explorer_ view allows you to browse the files of Eclipse projects.
If you for example rename a file via the _Package Explorer_ view, the file name is directly changed on the file system.

Editors are typically used to modify a single data element, e.g., the content of a file or a data object.
To apply the changes made in an editor to the data structure, the user has to explicitly save the editor content.

For example, the _Java_ editor is used to modify Java source files.
Changes to the source file are applied once the user selects the _Save_ button.
A dirty editor tab is marked with an asterisk left to the name of the modified file.
