== Parts




	
		Parts
		are user interface components which allow you to navigate
		and modify
		data. A
		part
		can have a drop-down menu,
		context menus and a
		toolbar.
		The Parts can be stacked or positioned next to each other
		depending on the container into
		which they are dropped.

		Parts
		are typically classified as
		_views_
		and
		_editors_
		.
	
	
		A
		view
		is
		typically
		used to work on a set of data, which might be a
		hierarchical
		structure. If data
		is
		changed via the
		view,
		this change is
		typically directly applied to the
		underlying data
		structure. A
		view
		sometimes allows the user to open
		an
		editor
		for the selected set of data.
		For example, the
		_Package Explorer_
		view allows you to browse the files of Eclipse projects. If you
		for example rename a file via the
		_Package Explorer_
		view, the
		file
		name
		is directly changed on the
		file
		system.
	
	
		Editors
		are
		typically used to modify a single data element, e.g.,
		the content of a
		file or a
		data object. To apply the
		changes made in an
		editor to the
		data
		structure, the user has to explicitly save the
		editor content.
	

	
		For example, the
		_Java_
		editor
		is used to modify Java source files. Changes to the source file
		are
		applied once the user selects the
		_Save_
		button. A dirty editor tab is marked with an asterisk
		left to the
		name of the modified file.
