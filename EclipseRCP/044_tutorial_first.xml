== Exercise: Wizard to create an RCP application


=== Target
		
			The following exercise demonstrates how to create an Eclipse RCP application based on a template.
			It also shows
			how to
			start
			the application via
			the Eclipse IDE. You learn all the details of what happened here in later
			chapters.
		
	

=== Create project
		
			Select
			menu:File[New > Other... > Plug-in Development > Plug-in Project]
			from the menu of your Eclipse IDE.

			Create a
			project called
			`com.example.e4.rcp.wizard`
			.
			Use the settings similar to the following
			screenshots, most of them are the default settings.

			On the last wizard page, select the
			_Create sample content (parts, menu etc.)_
			flag. Via this flag
			you configure that
			the generated application has
			example content, e.g., a
			view
			and some menu and
			toolbar entries.

		NOTE:
			
				The wizard adds also the

				_clearPersistedState_
				flag to the product configuration file. This ensures that changes
				during development in
				your
				application model are
				always visible. See
				<xref linkend="tutorial_clearpesistence_task" />
				for more information.
			
		</note>
	


=== Launch your Eclipse application via the product file
		
			Open the generated
			product file by double-clicking on the file.

			Switch to
			the
			_Overview_
			tab in the editor and
			launch your
			Eclipse application
			by pressing the
			_Launch an Eclipse application_
			hyperlink. This selection is highlighted in the following screenshot.
