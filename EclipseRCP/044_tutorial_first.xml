=== Target
		
			The following exercise demonstrates how to create an Eclipse RCP application based on a template.
			It also shows
			how to
			start
			the application via
			the Eclipse IDE. You learn all the details of what happened here in later
			chapters.
		
	
[[tutorial_e4wizard_project">

			On the last wizard page, select the
			_Create sample content (parts, menu etc.)_
			flag. Via this flag
			you configure that
			the generated application has
			example content, e.g., a
			view
			and some menu and
			toolbar entries.

			<primary>clearPersistedState</primary>
		</indexterm>
		<indexterm>
			<primary>Create sample content (parts, menu etc.)</primary>
		</indexterm>

		<note>
			
				The wizard adds also the

				<parameter>clearPersistedState</parameter>
				flag to the product configuration file. This ensures that changes
				during development in
				your
				application model are
				always visible. See
				<xref linkend="tutorial_clearpesistence_task" />
				for more information.
