== The usage of run configurations

=== What are run configurations?

A _run configuration_ defines the environment which will be used to execute a generic launch.
For example, it defines arguments to the Java virtual machine (VM), plug-in (classpath) dependencies, etc.

If you start an Eclipse application the corresponding run configuration is automatically created or updated.

TIP: If you are starting an Eclipse runtime IDE for testing, and clear the workspace location the next run will prompt you to choose a workspace.

=== Reviewing run configurations

To review and edit your run configurations select menu:Run[Run Configurations...] from the Eclipse menu.

On the _Main_ tab in the field _Location_, you specify where the Eclipse IDE creates the files necessary to start your Eclipse based application.

=== Run arguments

(((Run arguments, Run configuration arguments)))
(((Run configuration arguments, consoleLog)))
(((Run configuration arguments, console)))
(((Run configuration arguments, nl)))
(((Run configuration arguments, noExit)))
(((Run configuration arguments, clearPersistedState)))

The run configuration allows you to add additional start arguments for your application on the _Arguments_ tab.
By default Eclipse includes already several parameters, e.g. parameters for _-os_,_-ws_
and _-arch_ to specify the architecture on which the application is running.

TIP:To pass system properties to your Eclipse application, you can add launch parameters using the -D switch.
As example, if you add the argument _-Dmy.product.loglevel=INFO_, you can get the "INFO" value with `System.getProperties("my.product.loglevel")`.

The following table lists several useful launch arguments.

.Launch parameters
|===
|Parameter|Description

|_consoleLog_
|Error messages of the running Eclipse application are written to standard-out (`System.out`) which can be viewed in the Eclipse IDE _Console_ view that started the RCP application.

|_nl_
|Specifies the locale used for your application.
The locale defines the language specific settings, i.e., which translation is used and the number, date and currency formatting.
For example _-nl en_ starts your application using the English language.
This is useful for testing translations.

|_console_
|Provides access to an OSGi console where you can check the status of your application.

|_noExit_
|Keeps the OSGi console open even if the application crashes.
This allows to analyze the application dependencies even if the application crashes during startup.

|_clearPersistedState_
|Deletes cached runtime changes of the Eclipse 4 application model.
