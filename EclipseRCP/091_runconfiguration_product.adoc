== Launch configuration and Eclipse products

The launch configuration stores the settings from the product configuration file.
The launch configuration is created or updated every time you start your application via the product.

You can use the created run configuration directly for starting the application again.
In this case changes in the product configuration file are not considered.


WARNING: Using an existing run configuration is a common source of frustration and time consuming error analysis. To ensure that you use the latest configuration from your product, start your application via the product file.
