== Common launch problems


=== Checklist for common launch problems
		
			Errors in the run configurations of Eclipse RCP application
			are
			frequently the source of problems. This chapter describes common
			problems related to the start of
			RCP applications. It can be used as
			a
			reference in case you face
			issues during the startup of your
			application.
			The following table lists potential problems and
			solutions.

=== Finding missing plug-in dependencies during a product launch

		</indexterm>
		
			The most common problem is that some required plug-ins are
			missing in
			your product. If you are using a feature based product
			configuration,
			you need to
			ensure that all plug-ins which are referred
			to in the
			MANIFEST.MF
			file are also included in your features. This error is
			reported in the
			_Console_
			view, typically it is one of the first error messages and you need to
			scroll up to see it.
		
		The following listing shows how this message typically looks
			like (formating changed to make the text fit better).

			After identifying the missing plug-ins ensure that you add them
			to your product (if the product is plug-in based) or to your features
			(if the product is feature based).
		

		TIP:
			
				Eclipse can check for missing dependencies automatically before you
				run the Launch configuration.
				On
				the
				_Plug-ins_
				Tab press the
				_Validate Plug-ins_
				button or select the
				_Validate plug-ins automatically prior to launching
				_
				option.
				This
				will
				check if you have all the required plug-ins
				in your
				run
				configuration.

			Avoid fixing problems with dependencies in the run configuration
			because
			the run configuration is created and updated based on the
			product
			configuration file. So always ensure that the product file is
			correctly configured instead of changing the derived information. The
			product configuration is used for the
			export of your product, hence
			an error in the product dependencies results in an
			exported application which cannot be started.
