== Eclipse 4 application model

=== What is the application model?

The Eclipse platform uses an abstract description, called the _application model_, to describe the structure of an application.
 This application model contains the visual elements as well as some non-visual elements of the application.

The visual parts are, for example, windows, parts (views and editors), menus, toolbars, etc. Examples for non-visual components are handlers, commands and key bindings.

Each model element has attributes which describe its current state, e.g. the size and the position of a window.
The application model also expresses the relationship of the model elements via a hierarchy.

The individual user interface widgets, which are displayed in a part, are not defined via the application model, e.g., the content of the part is still defined by your source code.

If the application model was a house, it would describe the available rooms (parts) and their arrangement (perspectives, part stacks, part sash containers), but not the furniture of the rooms.
This is illustrated by the following image.

The base of the application model is typically defined as a static file.
By default, it is called `Application.e4xmi` and located in the main directory of the plug-in which defines the product extension.
This file is read at application startup and is used to construct the initial application model.
Changes made by the user are persisted and re-applied at startup.

The application model is extensible, e.g., other plug-ins can contribute to it via _model processors_ and
_model fragments_.

=== Connecting model elements to classes and resources
(((Class URI, bundleclass://)))
(((Class URI, platform:/plugin/)))
Model elements can point to a class or to a static resource via a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI).
For this purpose Eclipse defines two URI patterns.
Eclipse instantiates the referred objects or resources in most cases lazily.
For example, the classes for a part are instantiated when the part gets visible.

The following table describes the support URI patterns.
The example assumes that the bundle is called _test_ to have a short name.

|===
|Pattern |Description

|`bundleclass://Bundle-SymbolicName/package.classname`

<<<
Example: 

`bundleclass://test/test.parts.MySavePart`
|Identifier for a Java class.
It consists of the following parts: `bundleclass://` is a fixed prefix.
Bundle-SymbolicName is defined in _MANIFEST.MF_ file.
The Bundle-SymbolicName is followed by a '/' and the fully qualified classname.

|`platform:/plugin/Bundle-SymbolicName/path/filename.extension`

<<<
Example: 

`platform:/plugin/com.example.plugin/icons/save_edit.gif`

|Used to identify resources.
Identifier for a resource in a plug-in.
`platform:/plugin/` is a fixed prefix, followed by the Bundle-SymbolicName, followed by the path to the file and the filename.
|===

For example a part, have a `Class URI` attribute which points to a Java class via the `bundleclass://` URI.
This class provides the behavior of the part.
The corresponding object is created by the Eclipse framework.
Using the house/rooms metaphor from earlier, the class is responsible for defining the furnishings, the layout of the room and how the interactive objects behave.

An example for a static resource reference is the the `Icon URI` attribute of a part.
This attribute can point to an icon that is used for the part.

=== Runtime application model

At runtime of the application the created set of model objects is called the _runtime application model_.
This runtime application model is dynamic, i.e., you can change the model objects and its attributes and these changes are reflected in your application.
The Eclipse platform has change listeners registered on the model objects and updates the user interface whenever you change relevant attributes.
