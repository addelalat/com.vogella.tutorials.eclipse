== User interface model elements
	
The following model elements represents the basic elements which you use to create the user interface of your application.
	

=== Window

Eclipse applications consist of one or more windows.
Typically, an application has only one window, but you are not limited to that, e.g., if you want to support multiple connected monitors.

=== Parts

Parts are user interface components which allow you to navigate and modify data.
Parts can be stacked or positioned next to each other depending on the container into which they are dropped.
A part can have a drop-down menu, context menus and a toolbar.

Parts can be classified as _views_ and _editors_.

A view is typically used to work on a set of data, which might be a hierarchical structure.
If data is changed via the view, this change is typically directly applied to the underlying data structure.
A view sometimes allows the user to open an editor for the selected set of data.
For example, the _Package Explorer_ view allows you to browse the files of Eclipse projects.
If you for example rename a file via the _Package Explorer_ view, the file name is directly changed on the file system.

Editors are typically used to modify a single data element, e.g., the content of a file or a data object.
To apply the changes made in an editor to the data structure, the user has to explicitly save the editor content.

For example, the _Java_ editor is used to modify Java source files.
Changes to the source file are applied once the user selects the _Save_ button.
A dirty editor tab is marked with an asterisk left to the name of the modified file.

=== Available part containers
(((Part sash container, Layout weight)))

Parts can be directly assigned to a window or a perspective.
They can also be grouped and arranged via additional model elements, i.e., via part stack (_Part Stack_) or via part sash container (_Part Sash Container_) elements.

A part stack contains a stack of parts showing the content of
one part while displaying only the headers of the other parts.
One part is active and the user can switch to another part by selecting the corresponding tab.

A part sash container displays all its children at the same time
either
horizontally or
vertically aligned.

The following screenshot shows a simple Eclipse application layout using two part sash container and three part stacks.

On the top of this layout there is a horizontal part sash container which contains another part sash container and one part stacks.
The part sash container on the next level contains two part stacks.
The hierarchy is depicted in the following graphic.

You can use the _Container Data_ attribute on a child of a part sash container to assign a layout weight.
This layout weight is interpreted as the relative space the corresponding child element should get assigned in the part sash container.
The setting is depicted in the following screenshot.

If you set the _Container Data_ for one element, you must define it for all the other elements, too.
Otherwise the missing values are interpreted as very high and these
elements take up all available space.

TIP:The initial total of all the container data values is
maintained when elements in the sash are moved.
In order to allow fine grained/smooth dragging this total must be similar to the
screen resolution.
A too low value (i.e., 50 / 50) causes the part to be moved multiple pixels per sash unit, which the user will realize as a jerky movement.
Therefore, use a sufficient high value, e.g., 10000.

=== Perspective

A perspective is an optional container for a set of parts.
Perspectives can be used to store different arrangements of parts.
For example, the Eclipse IDE uses them to layout the views appropriate to the task (development, debugging, review, ...) the developer wants to perform.

You can place perspectives in a perspective stack of the application model.
Switching perspectives can be done via the part service provided by the Eclipse platform.
