=== From plug-in to Eclipse 4 application

In this chapter you convert the generated plug-in into an Eclipse RCP application.

==== Create a project to host the product configuration file

Create a new project called _com.example.e4.rcp.todo.product_ via menu:File[New > Others... > General > Project].

image::productproject10.png[]

Enter the project name and press btn:[Finish].

image::productproject12.png[]

==== Create a product configuration file

Right-click on this project and select menu:File[New > Others... > Plug-in Development > Product Configuration].

image::training_product10.png[]

Create a product configuration file called _todo.product_ inside the _com.example.e4.rcp.todo.product_ folder.

image::training_product20.png[]

Press the btn:[Finish] button.
The file is created and opened in an editor.

Press the btn:[New...] button on the _Overview_ tab of the product editor.

image::training_product28.png[Press the new button in the product editor]

Enter _to-do_ as the _Product Name_, your plug-in as the _Defining Plug-in_, _product_ as the _Product ID_ and select `org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench.swt.E4Application` in the _Application_ combo box.

==== Configure the start levels

(((Start level in a product)))
(((Product Configuration, Start Level)))
Switch to the _Configuration_ tab in the product editor and press the btn:[Add Recommended...] button.
These settings are for example used by the Maven/Tycho build system, hence it is good practice to configure them.

==== Create a feature project

Create a new feature project called _com.example.e4.rcp.todo.feature_ via menu:File[New > Other... > Plug-in Development > Feature Project].

You can press the btn:[Finish] button on the first wizard page.

image::training_product31.png[Feature project]

Afterwards select the _Included Plug-ins_ tab in the editor of the _feature.xml_ file. 
Press the btn:[Add...] button and include the `com.example.e4.rcp.todo` plug-in into this feature.

[WARNING]
====
Ensure you have added the plug-in on the _Included Plug-ins_ tab to include it into your feature.
Using the _Dependencies_ tab is wrong for this exercise.
====

==== Enter the feature as content into the product
Open your _todo.product_ product file and change your product configuration file to use features.

For this select the _features_ option on the _Overview_ tab of the product editor.

image::e4_productfeature10.png[Switching to feature on the product configuration file]

Select the _Contents_ tab and add the following features via the
btn:[Add...] button.

* `com.example.e4.rcp.todo.feature`
* `org.eclipse.e4.rcp`
* `org.eclipse.emf.ecore`
* `org.eclipse.emf.common`

[NOTE]
====
If you cannot add one of the listed features to your product, ensure that you have changed your product to be based on features.
====

==== Remove the version dependency from the features in the product

To avoid problems with different versions of your features, delete the version number from your product.
You can do this via the btn:[Properties...] button on the _Contents_ tab of the product configuration editor.

image::e4_productfeature26.png[Remove version number]

image::e4_productfeature28.png[Remove version number]

Remove the version dependency from all features.
The result should look similar to the following screenshot.

==== Create an application model

Now create an application model file in your `com.example.e4.rcp.todo` plug-in.
Select menu:File[New > Other... > Eclipse 4 >  Model > New Application Model] to open a wizard.

image::training_product48.png[]

Enter your `com.example.e4.rcp.todo` application plug-in as the container and use the file name suggested by the wizard.

image::training_product50.png[]

Press the btn:[Finish] button.
This triggers the creation of the _Application.e4xmi_ file inside the `com.example.e4.rcp.todo` plug-in and opens it.

==== Add a window to the application model

Add one window to your application model so you have a visual component.

Right-click on the _Windows and Dialogs_ node, and select `Trimmed Window` as depicted in the following screenshot.

image::tutorial_product80.png[Adding a trimmed window]

Enter an ID with the `taskmanager` suffix, the position and size of the window and a label as shown in the screenshot below.

image::tutorial_product90.png[Enter the data for the TrimmedWindow in the model editor]

[[tutorial_clearpesistence_task]]
==== Ensure to delete the persisted user interface state at startup

If you start and close your application the last state of the application is persisted by the framework and restored the next time you start this application.
This is undesired during development, as the latest state from the application model file should be used.
To ensure that always the latest version of your application model is used, add the _-clearPersistedState_ parameter to your product configuration file.

The following screenshot shows this setting in the product configuration file.

image::deletepersistedmodel10.png[Delete persisted Eclipse application model]


[WARNING]
====
Ensure that you used the _-_ sign and that the parameter is typed correctly.
Is must be: _-clearPersistedState_
====


==== Start the application

Open the product file and select the _Overview_ tab.
Press the _Launch an Eclipse application_ hyperlink in the _Testing_ section.

image::training_product40.png[Starting the product]

Validate that your application starts. You should see an empty window, which can be moved, resized, minimized, maximized and closed.
