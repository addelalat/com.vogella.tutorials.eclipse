	<title>Exercise: Configure the deletion of persisted model data
[[tutorial_clearpesistence_task">
=== Delete the persisted user changes at startup

		
			To ensure that always the latest version of your application model is
			used, add the
			<parameter>-clearPersistedState</parameter>
			parameter to your product configuration file.
		

		The following screenshot shows this setting in the product
			configuration file.

		<note>
			
				Ensure that you used the
				<parameter>-</parameter>
				sign and that the parameter is typed correctly. Is must be:
			
			
				<parameter>-clearPersistedState</parameter>
			
		</note>

	
[[tutorial_clearpesistence_why">
=== Why is this setting necessary?

		
			At startup of an Eclipse application the Eclipse platform
			restores the state in which you
			left the application
			before the last
			shutdown.
			During
			development
			this
			might
			lead to
			situations where changes
			are not
			correctly
			applied and
			displayed, e.g., you define a new menu
			entry
			and
			this entry
			is not
			displayed in your application.
		


		
			Alternatively to the approach described above, you can also set the
			_Clear_
			flag on the
			_Main_
			tab in your Run configuration. This would also delete other persisted
			data, like for example preference values.
