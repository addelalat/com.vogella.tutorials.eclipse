		<title>Why is this setting necessary?</title>

		<para>
			At startup of an Eclipse application the Eclipse platform
			restores the state in which you
			left the application
			before the last
			shutdown.
			During
			development
			this
			might
			lead to
			situations where changes
			are not
			correctly
			applied and
			displayed, e.g., you define a new menu
			entry
			and
			this entry
			is not
			displayed in your application.
		</para>


		<para>
			Alternatively to the approach described above, you can also set the
			<guilabel>Clear</guilabel>
			flag on the
			<guilabel>Main</guilabel>
			tab in your Run configuration. This would also delete other persisted
			data, like for example preference values.
		</para>
