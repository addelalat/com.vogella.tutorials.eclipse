=== Modeling a User Interface

In the this part of the exercise, you create the basis of the application user interface. 
At the end of this exercise, your user interface should look similar to the following screenshot.

==== Open the Application.e4xmi file

Open the _Application.e4xmi_ file in the _Eclipse 4 model editor_ via a double-click or right-click on it and select menu:Open With[Eclipse 4 model editor].

Enter the _To-do_ value in the _Label_ field and the _com.example.e4.rcp.todo.perspective_ value in the _ID_ field, either via the context menu or the btn:[Add...] button.

Add a part stack as the first child to your part sash container element.

Re-select the parent part sash container and add another *part sash container* element.
Add to stacks to this new element.

After these changes your application model should look similar to the following screenshot.

==== Create the parts

Add one part to the first sash container and two parts to the second sash container.

After these changes your application model should look similar to the following screenshot.

Use the ID and label from the following table.

[TIP]
====
Enter the name first, the ID should be adjusted based on the name, if the label was empty.

The final structure of your application model should be similar to the following screenshot.

==== Validate the user interface

Start your product and validate that the user interface looks as planned.
Reassign your model elements if required.
The model editor supports drag-and drop for reassignment.

Also note that you can already see the structure, even though you have not created any Java classes so far.
