== Exercise: Modeling a User Interface

=== Desired user interface

In the following exercises you create the basis of the application user interface. At the end of this exercise your user interface should look similar to the following screenshot.

=== Open the Application.e4xmi file

Open the _Application.e4xmi_ file in the _Eclipse 4 model editor_ via a double-click or right-click on it and select menu:Open With[Eclipse 4 model editor].

=== Add a perspective

Add a perspective stack with one perspective to your application model so that you can later easily add more of them.

Navigate to your window inside the _Application.e4xmi_ file. Select the _Controls_ node.
Add a _Perspective Stack_ via the context menu on the _Controls_ entry as indicated in the following screenshot.

TIP:Alternatively to the context menu you can also use the btn:[Add...] button on the detail page to add child elements to the selected element.

After creating the perspective stack add a _Perspective_ to it, either via the context menu or the btn:[Add...] button.

Enter the _To-do_ value in the _Label_ field and the _com.example.e4.rcp.todo.perspective_ value in the _ID_ field.

=== Add part sash and part stack containers

Select _Controls_ below the newly created perspective and add a part sash container element.

Change its _Orientation_ attribute to _Horizontal_ and enter into the ID field the _com.example.e4.rcp.todo.partsashcontainer.main_ value.

Add a part stack as the first child to your part sash container element.

Re-select the parent part sash container and add another part sash container element.
Now add two part stacks to the second part sash container.

After these changes your application model should look similar to the following screenshot.

=== Create the parts

Add a part model element to each part stack.
As ID for the parts use the prefix `com.example.e4.rcp.todo.part` and the suffix from the following table.
Also put the label from the table into the appropriate field of the part editor.

.Label and ID from the Parts
|===
|ID Suffix |Label

|.todooverview
|Overview

|.tododetails
|Details

|.playground
|playground
|===

The final structure of your application model should be similar to the following screenshot.
The screenshot also shows the detailed data of the overview part inside the detail pane of the application model editor.

=== Validate the user interface

Start your product and validate that the user interface looks as planned.
Reassign your model elements if required.
The model editor supports drag-and drop for reassignment.

Also note that you can already see the structure, even though you have not created any Java classes so far.
