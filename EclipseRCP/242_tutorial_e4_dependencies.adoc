== Enter the dependencies

=== Add the plug-in dependencies

In the source code of you new plug-in, you will later use the API from other Eclipse plug-ins.
The Eclipse programming model requires that you define a dependency to such plug-ins or packages in your new plug-in. 

Remember that _application plug-in_ is the short form for the `com.example.e4.rcp.todo` plug-in.

Open the _META-INF/MANIFEST.MF_ file in your _application plug-in_ and select the _Dependencies_ tab.
Use the btn:[Add...] button in the _Required Plug-ins_ section to add the following plug-ins as dependency.

* org.eclipse.core.runtime
* org.eclipse.swt
* org.eclipse.e4.core.di
* org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench
* org.eclipse.e4.ui.di
* org.eclipse.e4.core.di.extensions

=== Validating

The result should be similar to the following screenshot.
