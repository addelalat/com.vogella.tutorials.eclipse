== Enter the dependencies


=== Add the plug-in dependencies
		
			In the upcoming exercises you will use
			the functionality from
			other
			Eclipse plug-ins. This requires that you define a dependency to
			these
			plug-ins in your application. 
		
		
			Remember that
			_application plug-in_
			is the short form for the
			`com.example.e4.rcp.todo`
			plug-in.
		
		
			Open the
			_META-INF/MANIFEST.MF_
			file in your
			_application plug-in_
			and select the
			_Dependencies_
			tab.
			Use the
			_Add..._
			button in the
			_Required Plug-ins_
			section to
			add the following plug-ins as
			dependency.
