=== Connect Java classes with the parts

==== Create a new package and some Java classes

Create the `com.example.e4.rcp.todo.parts` package in the application plug-in.

Create three Java classes called _TodoOverviewPart_, _TodoDetailsPart_ and _PlaygroundPart_ in this package.
All classes should not extend another class, nor should they implement any interface.

[TIP]
====
You can create the classes by clicking on the _Class URI_ hyperlink in the detail pane of the model editor for the part.
This also connects the created class to the model object.
If you do this, you can skip <<tutorial_modelelementsclasses>>.
====

The following code shows the `TodoDetailsPart` class.

[source,java]
----
include::res/start/TodoDetailsPart.java[]
----

[[tutorial_modelelementsclasses]]
==== Connect the Java classes with your parts
		
Open the _Application.e4xmi_ file and connect the class with the corresponding part model element.
You can do this via the _Class URI_ property of the part model element.

[TIP]
====
The Eclipse 4 model editor allows you to search for an existing class via the btn:[Find...] button.
The initial list of _Contribution Classes_ is empty, start typing in the _Class Name_ field to see the results.

The following table gives an overview of which elements should be connected.

|*.todooverview

|TodoDetailsPart
|*.tododetails

|PlaygroundPart
|*.playground

The following screenshot shows the result for the overview part.

==== Validating

Start your application.
It should start, but you should see no difference in the user interface.

To validate that the model objects are created by the Eclipse runtime create a no-argument constructor for one of the classes and add a `System.out.println()` statement.
Verify that the constructor is called, once you start the application.
