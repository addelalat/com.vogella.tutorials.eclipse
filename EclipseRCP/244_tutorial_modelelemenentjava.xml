	<title>Exercise: Connect Java classes with the parts
[[tutorial_modelelements2">
=== Create a new package and some Java classes
		
			Create the
			<code>com.example.e4.rcp.todo.parts</code>
			package in the application plug-in.
		
		
			Create three Java classes called
			_TodoOverviewPart_
			,
			_TodoDetailsPart_
			and
			_PlaygroundPart_
			in this package.
		
		<tip>
			
				You can create the classes by clicking on the
				_Class URI_
				hyperlink in the detail pane of the model editor for the part. This also
				connects the created class to the model
				object. If you do this, you
				can skip
				<xref linkend="tutorial_modelelementsclasses" />
				of this exercise.
			
		</tip>
		
			The following code shows the
			<code>TodoDetailsPart</code>
			class. All classes
			should not
			extend
			another
			class, nor do they
			implement
			any
			interface.
		

		
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/start/TodoDetailsPart.java" />
			</programlisting>
		
	
[[tutorial_modelelementsclasses">
=== Connect the Java classes with your parts
		
			Open the
			<filename>Application.e4xmi</filename>
			file and connect the class with the
			corresponding part model element.
			You can do
			this via
			the
			<property>Class URI</property>
			property
			of
			the
			part
			model element.
		

		The following table gives an overview of which elements should
			be
			connected.
		
		
			<table frame='all'>

			The Eclipse 4 model editor allows you to search for an existing
			class
			via the
			<guibutton>Find...</guibutton>
			button. The initial list of
			_Contribution Classes_
			is empty, start typing in the
			_Class Name_
			field to see the results.

=== Validating

		 Run your application. It should start, but you should see no
			difference in the user interface.
		

		
			To validate that the model objects are created by the Eclipse runtime
			create a no-argument constructor for one of the
			classes and add a
			<code>System.out.println()</code>
			statement.

			Afterwards verify that the constructor is called, once you
			start the
			application.
