== Exercise: Using the SWT browser widget

=== Implementation

In this exercise you will display Google Maps in an SWT `Browser` widget.

		
[NOTE]
====
This exercise does not always work on a Linux system because on certain Linux versions the `Browser` widget does not work.
See the Eclipse SWT FAQ answered at http://www.eclipse.org/swt/faq.php#browserwebkitgtk

How do I use the WebKit renderer on Linux-GTK for details.
====

Change the `PlaygroundPart` class so the part looks like the following screenshot.

NOTE: This example might not work, in case Google changes its API.

If you enter a text in the text field and press the button, the map should center based on the input in the text field.
This input should be interpreted as city.

=== Solution

Your `PlaygroundPart` class should look similar to the following code.

include::res/playground/PlaygroundPart.java[]
