	<title>Exercise: Using the SWT browser widget
[[tutorial_mapsimplementation">
=== Implementation
		
			In this exercise you will display Google Maps in an SWT
			<code>Browser</code>
			widget.
		
		<note>
			
				This exercise does not always work on a
				Linux system because on
				certain Linux versions the
				<code>Browser</code>
				widget does not work. See the Eclipse SWT FAQ answered at
				http://www.eclipse.org/swt/faq.php#browserwebkitgtk">
					How do I use the WebKit renderer on Linux-GTK
				for details.
			
		</note>
		
			Change the
			<code>PlaygroundPart</code>
			class so the
			part
			looks like the following screenshot.

		<note>
			This example might not work, in case Google changes its API.
			
		</note>

		If you enter a text in the text field and press the button, the
			map should center based on the input in the text field. This
			input
			should be interpreted as city.
		

	

[[tutorial_mapsresult">
=== Solution

		
			Your
			<code>PlaygroundPart</code>
			class
			should look similar to the following code.
		

		
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/playground/PlaygroundPart.java" />
			</programlisting>
