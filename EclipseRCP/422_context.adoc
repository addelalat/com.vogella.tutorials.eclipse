== The Eclipse context

=== What is the Eclipse context?

(((IEclipseContext, Eclipse context)))

During startup of an Eclipse application the Eclipse runtime creates an object based on the `IEclipseContext` interface.
This object is called the _context_ or the _Eclipse context_.

The context is similar to a `Map` data structure, in which objects can be placed under a certain key.
The key is a String and in several cases the fully qualified class name is used as key.
The value (to which the key points) can be injected into other objects.

=== Relationship definition in the Eclipse context

(((Eclipse context, Hierarchy)))

As described earlier the Eclipse context is similar to a `Map` data structure.
But unlike a map, the Eclipse context is hierarchical and can also dynamically compute values for requested keys.

For certain model objects (see <<context_modelelementswithcontext" />) a local context is created.
Such a context is associated with an application model object.

The different context objects are connected to form a hierarchical tree structure based on the structure of your application model.
The highest level in this hierarchy is the application context.

A sample context hierarchy is depicted in the following picture.

Objects can be placed at different levels in the context hierarchy.
This allows that the same key points to different objects in the hierarchy.

For example, a part can express a dependency to a `Composite` object via a field declaration similar to: `@Inject Composite parent;`
Since parts have different local contexts they can receive different objects of the type `Composite`.

=== Which model elements have a local context?

Currently the following model elements implement the `MContext` interface and therefore have their own context:

* MApplication
* MWindow
* MPerspective
* MPart
* MPopupMenu

=== Life cycle of the Eclipse context

(((Eclipse context, Life cycle)))

The Eclipse framework creates the context hierarchy based on the application model during the start process.
By default, it places certain objects under predefined keys into the context, e.g., services to control the Eclipse framework functionality.

The model objects and the created objects based on the _class URI_ attributes are created by the Eclipse platform.
For each model element with a custom context the Eclipse framework determines which objects should be available in the local context of the model object.
If required, it also creates the required Java objects referred by the _Class URI_ property of the model elements. This is for example the case if a part is visible to the user.


[NOTE]
====
The renderer framework is responsible for creating the local context of the UI related model elements.
This framework allows you to define classes which are responsible for setting up the UI implementation of the model objects.
A class responsible for a model element is called the _renderer_ for this model element.

For example, the `ContributedPartRenderer` class is the default renderer for part model objects.
This renderer creates a `Composite` for every part and puts this `Composite` into the local context of the part.
====

After the initial creation of the Eclipse context hierarchy, the framework or the application code can change the key-value pairs stored in the context.
In this case objects which were created with the related Eclipse
functionality (for example by the Eclipse dependency injection framework) are updated with the new values.

Objects in the context are persisted in memory (transient), i.e., once the application is stopped the context gets destroyed.
