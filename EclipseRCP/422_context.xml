		<para>
			During startup of an Eclipse application the Eclipse runtime creates
			an object
			based on the
			<code>IEclipseContext</code>
			interface. This object is called the
			<wordasword>context</wordasword>
			or the
			<wordasword>Eclipse context</wordasword>
			.
		</para>

		<para>
			The context is similar to a
			<code>Map</code>
			data structure,
			in which
			objects
			can be
			placed under a certain key. The
			key is a
			String and in several cases the fully
			qualified class name is
			used as key. The value (to which the key points) can be
			injected
			into
			other objects.

		<para>
			As described earlier the Eclipse context is similar to a
			<code>Map</code>
			data structure. But unlike a map, the Eclipse context is
			hierarchical
			and
			can also
			dynamically compute
			values for
			requested
			keys.
		</para>


		<para>
			For certain model objects (see
			<xref linkend="context_modelelementswithcontext" />
			) a local context is created. Such a context is
			associated with
			an
			application model object.
		</para>
		<para>
			The different context objects are
			connected to
			form a hierarchical tree
			structure based
			on
			the
			structure
			of
			your
			application model.
			The highest
			level in
			this
			hierarchy is the application context.

		</para>
		<para>
			A sample context hierarchy
			is
			depicted in the
			following picture.

		<para> Objects can be placed
			at different levels in the context
			hierarchy. This allows that the same key points to
			different objects
			in the hierarchy.
		</para>
		<para>
			For
			example, a
			part
			can express a dependency to a
			<code>Composite</code>
			object via a field declaration similar to:
			<code>@Inject Composite parent;</code>
			Since
			parts
			have
			different
			local contexts they can receive different
			objects of the
			type
			<code>Composite</code>
			.

		<para>
			The Eclipse framework creates the context hierarchy based on the application model during
			the start process.
			By
			default, it places certain objects under predefined keys into the context, e.g., services to
			control the Eclipse
			framework
			functionality.
		</para>
		<para>
			The model objects and the created objects based on
			the
			<wordasword>class URI</wordasword>
			attributes are created by
			the Eclipse
			platform.
			For each model element
			with a custom context the Eclipse framework
			determines which
			objects
			should be
			available
			in the local context of the model object.
			If required, it also creates
			the
			required
			Java
			objects
			referred by the
			<parameter>Class URI</parameter>
			property of the
			model elements. This is for example the case if a part is visible to the user.
		</para>
		<note>
			<para>
				The renderer framework is responsible for creating the local
				context
				of the UI related model elements.
				This
				framework
				allows
				you to
				define
				classes which are responsible for setting up the UI
				implementation
				of the
				model
				objects. A class
				responsible for a model element is called the
				<wordasword>renderer</wordasword>
				for this model element.
			</para>
			<para>
				For
				example,
				the
				<code>ContributedPartRenderer</code>
				class is the default renderer for part
				model objects.
				This renderer
				creates a
				<code>Composite</code>
				for every
				part
				and puts this
				<code>Composite</code>
				into the local context of the
				part.
			</para>
		</note>

		<para>After the initial creation of the Eclipse context hierarchy, the
			framework or the application code can change the
			key-value pairs
			stored in the context. In this case objects which were created with the related Eclipse
			functionality
			(for example by the Eclipse dependency
			injection
			framework) are updated with the new values.
		</para>
		<para>
			Objects in the context are
			persisted in
			memory
			(transient), i.e.,
			once the application is stopped the context gets
			destroyed.
