			If you use a framework in your application, you need to have a
			convention for how your application interacts with
			the
			framework.
			For
			example, if
			a Java object is responsible for
			handling a
			toolbar button
			click, the framework needs to know
			which
			method of this
			object needs to
			be called.
		
		For this purpose every framework defines an Application
			Programming
			Interface
			(API). This API defines how you can
			interact with the framework
			from your code.
			The API also defines the interaction
			of application objects
			created
			or
			controlled by the framework.
			Typically,
			a framework uses
			inheritance
			or
			annotations for this purpose.
		

	
[[programmingmodel_inheritance">
=== API definition via inheritance
		The "traditional" way of defining an API
			is via inheritance. This
			approach requires that your classes extend
			or
			implement framework
			classes and interfaces. The Eclipse 3.x platform API used this
			approach.
		
		
			The framework defines, for example, an abstract class which defines
			methods to be
			implemented.
			In the example of the
			toolbar button the method
			might be
			called
			<code>execute()</code>
			and the framework knows that this method must be called once the
			button is clicked.
		
		API definition via inheritance is a simple way to define an API,
			but
			it also couples the classes tightly to the
			framework. For example,
			testing the class without the framework is difficult. It also makes
			extending or updating the
			framework difficult as such an update may
			affect clients. This is why the Eclipse 4.x does not use this approach
			anymore.

			The Eclipse 4.x platform API is based on annotations, e.g.,
			annotations are used to
			identify which methods should
			be
			called at a
			certain point in
			time. These annotations are called
			_behavior annotations_
			.
		
		
			The
			following table lists the
			available
			behavior annotations for
			parts.

			The
			<code>@PostConstruct</code>
			,
			<code>@PreDestroy</code>
			annotations are included in the
			<code>javax.annotation</code>
			package.
			<code>@Persist</code>
			,
			<code>@PersistState</code>
			and
			<code>@Focus</code>
			are part of the
			<code>org.eclipse.e4.ui.di</code>
			package.
		
		
			Eclipse defines additional behavior annotations for commands and
			for the application life cycle which are covered
			in the respective
			chapters.
		
	
[[programmingmodel_annotationinject">
=== Behavior annotations imply method dependency injection
		
			Behavior annotations imply that the framework needs to
			provide the
			specified parameters to the method, i.e., the
			framework
			also
			performs
			method dependency
			injection.
			If you also add the
			<code>@Inject</code>
			annotation, the method is called twice, first
			during the
			dependency injection phase and later for the behavior
			annotation.
			This
			is typically undesired and therefore an error.
		

	

[[programmingmodel_postconstruct">
=== Use the @PostConstruct method to build the user interface
		
		
			It is recommended to construct the user interface of a part in a
			method annotated with the
			<code>@PostConstruct</code>
			annotation. It would also be possible to create the user interface
			in
			the
			constructor, but this is not recommended as
			field
			and method
			injection have not been
			done
			at
			this point.
		
		
			Creating the user interface
			in an
			<code>@PostConstruct</code>
			method
			requires that
			<code>@Inject</code>
			methods
			are aware that the user interface might not have been created
			yet.
		
	

[[postconstructmethodnotcalled">
=== Why is the @PostConstruct method not called?
		<indexterm>
			<primary>@PostConstruct method not called</primary>
		</indexterm>
		
			Both Java 7 and the Eclipse platform expose the
			<code>@PostConstruct</code>
			annotation. In your Eclipse application you need to tell
			the framework
			that the annotation from the Eclipse platform
			should be used.
		
		<note>
			
				Eclipse 4.6 (Neon) fixed that. In Eclipse Neon you do not need a versionized import for the
				<code>javax.annotation</code>
				package anymore.
			
		</note>
		
			In case your
			<code>@PostConstruct</code>
			method is not called, ensure that you have defined a
			dependency to
			<code>org.eclipse.core.runtime</code>
			in the
			<filename>MANIFEST.MF</filename>
			file. See
			http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse4/RCP/FAQ for details on this issue.
		
		<note>
			
				<code>org.eclipse.core.runtime</code>
				exports
				<code>javax.annotation</code>
				in the correct version. If you have a dependency to
				<code>org.eclipse.core.runtime</code>
				in your
				<filename>MANIFEST.MF</filename>
				file, no additional package dependency is needed. If, for some
				reasons, you want to avoid a dependency to
				<code>org.eclipse.core.runtime</code>
				, you
				could define a package
				dependency to the
				<code>javax.annotation</code>
				package and set the version to 1.0.0.
