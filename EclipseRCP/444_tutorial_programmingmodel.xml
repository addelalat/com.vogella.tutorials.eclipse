== Exercise: Using @PostConstruct

=== Implement an @PostConstruct method
		
			Add the following method to your
			`TodoOverviewPart`
			,
			`TodoDetailsPart`
			and
			`PlaygroundPart`
			classes. In case you created constructors for these classes you can
			remove them.
		
		
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/snippets/methods.java[]
----
		
	


=== Validating
		
			Run your application and validate that the
			`@PostConstruct`
			method
			is
			called. If this does not work, see
			<xref linkend="postconstructmethodnotcalled" />
			for a solution.
