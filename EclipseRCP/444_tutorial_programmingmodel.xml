	<title>Exercise: Using @PostConstruct
[[tutorial_api1">
=== Implement an @PostConstruct method
		
			Add the following method to your
			<code>TodoOverviewPart</code>
			,
			<code>TodoDetailsPart</code>
			and
			<code>PlaygroundPart</code>
			classes. In case you created constructors for these classes you can
			remove them.
		
		
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/snippets/methods.java" />
			</programlisting>
		
	

[[tutorial_api2">
=== Validating
		
			Run your application and validate that the
			<code>@PostConstruct</code>
			method
			is
			called. If this does not work, see
			<xref linkend="postconstructmethodnotcalled" />
			for a solution.
