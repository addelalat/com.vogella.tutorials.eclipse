== View, popup and dynamic menus

=== View menus

(((Menu, View / Part)))

You can define one menu in a part as a _view menu_.
Please note that the application model allows to define more than one menu but the default Eclipse implementation supports only one menu for a part.
To add a view menu entry, select the _Menus_ entry under the part and append a _ViewMenu_ model entry to it.

=== Popup menu (context menu)

(((Menu, Popup)))

You can also define a popup menu for SWT controls via the application model.
To achieve this create a _Popup Menu_ for the part which contains the SWT control.

The popup menu contains entries, as, for example, a HandledMenuItem.

After this the pop menu can be assigned to an SWT control with the `EMenuService` service which can be accessed via dependency injection.
This class provides the `registerContextMenu(control, id)` method for this purpose.
The _id_ parameter of the `registerContextMenu` method must be the ID attribute of your _Popup Menu_ model element.

The following pseudo code shows an example for the registration.
It uses a JFace viewer, as the popup menu needs to be registered on the SWT control, the example code demonstrates how to access this control.

If you want to implement this example, your plug-in must have dependencies defined for the `org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench.swt`, the `org.eclipse.e4.ui.services` and the `org.eclipse.e4.ui.model.workbench` plug-ins in its _MANIFEST.MF_ file.

=== Dynamic menu and toolbar entries

(((Menu, Dynamic)))

You can also create menu and toolbar entries at runtime with the _DynamicMenuContribution_ model element.

This model element points to a class in which you annotate a method with the `@AboutToShow` annotation.
The annotated method is called if the user selects the user interface element.
The `@AboutToHide` annotation can be used to annotate a method which is called before the menu is hidden.

In these methods you can dynamically create menu entries.
