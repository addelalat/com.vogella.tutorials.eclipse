== Toolbars, ToolControls and drop-down tool items

=== Adding toolbars to parts
(((Toolbar, View / Part)))
Toolbars in the application model are defined within the _Trimbars_ model element.
A trimbar can be defined for _TrimmedWindow_ model elements.
Via its _Side_ attribute you define if the trimbar should be placed on the top, left, right or bottom corner of the resulting window.

To add a toolbar to a view, set the _Toolbar_ flag on the model element for the part and create the entries in the application model.

Such an example setup is displayed in the following screenshot.

=== ToolControls

_ToolControl_ model element points to a Java class which can create controls that are displayed in the toolbar.

For example, the following code creates a `Text` field in the toolbar which looks like a search field.

[source,java]
----
include::res/toolitem/SearchToolItem.java[]
----

You can add such a `ToolControl`, for example, to your windows trimbar as depicted in the following screenshot.

The following screenshot shows this `ToolControl` used in an example RCP application.

=== Drop-down tool items
(((Toolbar, Drop-down)))
Set the _Menu_ attribute on an toolitem to be able to define a menu similar to the btn:[Run As...] button in the Eclipse IDE.
This button is depicted in the following screenshot.
