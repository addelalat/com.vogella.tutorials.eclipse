=== Passing parameters to commands
(((Commands, Parameters)))

You can also pass parameters to commands.
For this select a command and press the btn:[Add] button in the _Parameters_ section.

The ID is the identifier which you can use to get the parameter value injected via the `@Named` annotation.

image::e4_commandpara10.png[Add a parameter to a command]

In your HandledMenuItem or HandledToolItem add a parameter and put the ID from the command parameter definition into the _Name_ field.
The entry from the _Value_ field is passed to the handler of the command.

[WARNING]
====
The ID of the parameter is the important one.
This ID must be injected via the `@Named` annotation and used as _Name_ (second field) during the definition of the menu or toolbar.
This is highlighted in the following picture.
====

image::parameter_relationship10.png[Relationship between parameters in command and menu]

To get the parameter injected into your handler class you specify the ID of the parameter via the `@Named` annotation.
This is demonstrated in the following code example.

----
include::res/commandparameter/TestHandler.java[]

[TIP]
====
Alternatively to injecting each parameter, you can also inject the `ParameterizedCommand` command and access the parameters via API.

=== Usage of core expressions

The visibility of menus, toolbars and their entries can be restricted via _core expressions_.
You add the corresponding attribute in the application model to the ID defined by the `org.eclipse.core.expressions.definitions` extension point in the _plugin.xml_ file.

To add this extension point to your application, open the _plugin.xml_ file and select the _Dependencies_ tab in the editor.
Add the `org.eclipse.core.expressions` plug-in in the _Required Plug-ins_ section.

Afterwards select the _Extensions_ tab, press the btn:[Add] button and add the `org.eclipse.core.expressions.definitions` extension. You define an ID under which the core expression can be referred to in the application model.

Via right-click on the extension you can start building your expression.

The following example can be used to restrict the visibility of a menu entry based on the type of the current selection.
You will later learn how to set the current selection. Please note that the variable for the selection is currently called `org.eclipse.ui.selection`.
In Eclipse 3.x this variable is called `selection`.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/coreexpression/instanceof.xml[]
----

You can assign this core expression to your menu entry in the application model. It can be used to restrict the visibility of model elements.

This approach is similar to the definition of core expressions in Eclipse 3.x.

The values available for Eclipse 3.x are contained in the `ISources` interface and documented in the http://wiki.eclipse.org/Command_Core_Expressions[Eclipse core expressions wiki].
Eclipse 4 does not always support the same variables, but the wiki documentation might still be helpful.

=== Evaluate your own values in core expressions

You can also place values in the `IEclipseContext` of your application and use these for your visible-when evaluation.

The following code demonstrates an example handler class which places a value for the _myactivePartId_ key in the context (you will learn more about modifying the `IEclipseContext` later).

[source,java]
----
include::res/coreexpression/putactivePartId.txt[]
----

The following shows an example core expression which evaluates to `true` if an _myactivePartId_ key with the value `com.example.e4.rcp.ui.parts.todooverview` is found in the context.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/coreexpression/activepart.xml[]
----

This core expression can get assigned to a menu entry and control the visibility.
