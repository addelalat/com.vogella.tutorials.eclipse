=== Passing parameters to commands
		<indexterm>
			<primary>Commands</primary>
			<secondary>Parameters</secondary>
		</indexterm>
		
			You can also pass parameters to commands. For this select a command
			and
			press the
			_Add_
			button in the
			_Parameters_
			section.
		
		
			The ID is the identifier which you can use to get the parameter value
			injected via
			the
			`@Named`
			annotation.

			In your HandledMenuItem or HandledToolItem add a parameter and put
			the ID from the command parameter definition into
			the
			_Name_
			field. The
			entry from the
			_Value_
			field is passed to the handler of the command.

				The ID of the parameter is the important one. This ID must be
				injected via the
				`@Named`
				annotation and used as
				_Name_
				(second field) during the definition of the menu or toolbar. This is
				highlighted in the following picture.
			
		</warning>

			To get the parameter injected into your handler class you specify the
			ID of the parameter via the
			`@Named`
			annotation. This is demonstrated in the
			following code
			example.
		
		
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text"
					href="./examples/commandparameter/TestHandler.java[]

		TIP:
			
				Alternatively to injecting each parameter, you can also inject the
				`ParameterizedCommand`
				command and access
				the parameters via API.

=== Usage of core expressions
		
		
			The visibility of menus, toolbars and their entries can be restricted
			via
			_core expressions_
			. You add the corresponding attribute in the
			application model to the
			ID defined by the
			`org.eclipse.core.expressions.definitions`
			extension point in the
			_plugin.xml_
			file.
		
		
			To add this extension point to your application, open the
			_plugin.xml_
			file and select the
			_Dependencies_
			tab in the editor. Add the
			`org.eclipse.core.expressions`
			plug-in in the
			_Required Plug-ins_
			section.
		
		
			Afterwards select the
			_Extensions_
			tab, press the
			_Add_
			button
			and add the
			`org.eclipse.core.expressions.definitions`
			extension. You define an ID under which the core expression can be
			referred to in the application model.
		
		Via right-click on the extension you can start building
			your
			expression.
		


		
			The following example can be used to restrict the visibility of
			a menu
			entry based on the type of the current
			selection. You will later
			learn how to set the current selection. Please note that
			the variable
			for the
			selection is
			currently called
			`org.eclipse.ui.selection`
			. In Eclipse 3.x this variable is called
			`selection`
			.
		
		
			<programlisting language="xml">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/coreexpression/instanceof.adoc[]
			</programlisting>
		
		You can assign this core expression to your menu entry in the
			application model. It can be used to restrict the
			visibility of model
			elements.

image::e4_coreexpression12.png" scale="30[Assigning it to the menu entry,pdfwidth=60%]
		

		 This approach is similar to the definition of core expressions
			in Eclipse 3.x.
		
		
			The values available for Eclipse 3.x are contained in the
			`ISources`
			interface and documented in the
			http://wiki.eclipse.org/Command_Core_Expressions"> Eclipse
				core expressions wiki
			
			. Eclipse 4 does not always support the same variables, but
			the
			wiki
			documentation
			might still be helpful.
		

	


=== Evaluate your own values in core expressions
		
			You can also place values in the
			`IEclipseContext`
			of your application and use these for your visible-when evaluation.
		
		
			The following code demonstrates an example handler class which places
			a
			value for the
			_myactivePartId_
			key in the context (you will learn more
			about modifying the
			`IEclipseContext`
			later).
		
		
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text"
					href="./examples/coreexpression/putactivePartId.txt[]
----
		

		
			The following shows an example core expression which evaluates to
			`true`
			if an
			_myactivePartId_
			key
			with the value
			`com.example.e4.rcp.ui.parts.todooverview`
			is found in the context.
		

		
			<programlisting language="xml">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/coreexpression/activepart.adoc[]
			</programlisting>
		

		This core expression can get assigned to a menu entry and
			control the visibility.
