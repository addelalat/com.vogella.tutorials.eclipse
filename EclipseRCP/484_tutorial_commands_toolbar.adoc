== Exercise: Adding a toolbar

In this exercise you add a toolbar to your application. 

=== Adding a toolbar

Select the _TrimBars_ node under your _TrimmedWindow_ entry and press the btn:[Add...] button.
The _Side_ attribute should be set to _Top_, so that all toolbars assigned to that trimbar appear on the top of the application.

Add a _Handled ToolItem_ to this toolbar which points to the `org.eclipse.ui.file.saveAll` command.

Set the label for this entry to _Save_.
