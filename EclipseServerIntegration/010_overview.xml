== Eclipse server integration

=== Presentation and the persistence layer
		In an application you typically have a layer which persists the data and another layer which represents the
			data. In an Eclipse RCP application you have the RCP part for the representation. The persistence layer can be a data
			base, the file system or a storage system handled by a remote server.
		
	

=== 1-tier Architecture
		A 1-tier layer for an Eclipse RCP application is if the data of the RCP application is stored locally. This can
			be, for example, via the file system or an embedded database.
		
	

=== 2-tier Architecture
		A 2-tier layer for an Eclipse RCP application is if the data is stored in a database and the Eclipse RCP
			application
			communications directly with the database server. In this scenario, typically JDBC or JPA with a SQL
			database is used. Alternately no SQL based database, like MongoDB, can be used.
		
		Updates in the storage layer require an update in the RCP application.
	

=== 3-tier Architecture
		In an 3-tier architecture the RCP application communications with a server application. This server application
			handles the storage of the data and the communication with the storage layer.
