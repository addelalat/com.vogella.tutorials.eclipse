== Using the JPA in an OSGi environment

The usage of JPA to access a database, either embedded or standalone, requires a special setup, as you must
configure JPA to run in an OSGi runtime.

In case JPA should be used within an OSGi environment, e.g., an Eclipse RCP application,
some rules have to be considered.

* Tell the `PersistenceProvider`, which classloader should be used
* Place the _persistence.xml_ in the _META-INF_ folder of the bundle, where the `EntityManager` is created
