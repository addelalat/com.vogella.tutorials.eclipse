== Shortcuts


=== Using shortcuts in Eclipse
		Using shortcuts make a developer more productive.
			Eclipse
			provides keyboard shortcuts for the most common actions.
			Using
			shortcuts is usually preferable as you can perform actions
			much
			faster.
		
		
			Eclipse supports of course the typical shortcuts, e.g.
			kbd:[Ctrl+S]
			for saving,
			kbd:[Ctrl+C]
			for copying the selected text or file and
			kbd:[Ctrl+V</keycap>

			</keycombo>
			for pasting the element currently in the clipboard.
		


	

=== Shortcuts on Mac OS

		This description uses the shortcuts based on Windows and Linux.

			Ctrl key.
