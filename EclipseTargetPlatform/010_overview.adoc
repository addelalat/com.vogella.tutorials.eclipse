== Target platform

=== Target platform for defining available plug-ins for development

The set of plug-ins available for your application development is defined by the plug-ins in your workspace in addition to the plug-ins defined by your _target platform_.
For example, the SWT and JFace plug-ins are typically provided by your target platform.
By default, the plug-in installed in your Eclipse IDE installation are used as target platform.


It is good practice to develop and build against a explicit target definition which is stored in a configuration file.
This way the plug-in dependencies and the used versions are controlled and specified during the development. 
A target definition file is typically shared between the developers to ensure that everyone is using the same basis for development.
If such a target definition file does not exists, than every developer develops against his version of the Eclipse IDE, which can lead to incompatible changes.

=== Defining a target platform

You can specify your target platform with a _target definition file_. 
With such a file you define the available plug-ins and features.

TIP: A target platform can be defined based on software sites (p2 update sites) or other means. 
As build systems like Maven Tycho support only p2 update sites, it is recommended to use only these.
	
A target definition file can be created via menu:File[New > Other... > Plug-in Development > Target Definition].

You can add new locations via the btn:[Add...] button in the Locations section. 
To add an Eclipse p2 update site, select _Software Site_ and specify the URL.
	
Once you have a target definition file, you can set it as the target platform in your Eclipse IDE.
This can be done via the _Set as Target Platform_ link in the Target definition editor as depicted in the following screenshot.

TIP: Wait until the target platform is completely resolved before setting it as target platform.
	
All plug-ins you are planning to use in your application and test code must be included in the target definition. 
For example, if you want to  use SWTBot for unit tests, add _SWTBot for SWT Testing_ features from http://download.eclipse.org/technology/swtbot/releases/latest/ to your target platform.

You can switch the target platform in the Eclipse Preferences.
Select menu:Window[Preferences > Plug-in Development > Target Platform].

A preferred way of defining your target platform is to use (p2) update sites. 
These are of the same type as the update sites that you used to install a new set of plug-ins. 
If the content in the update sites defined by your target platform changes, your local set of plug-ins can be updated.

[NOTE]
====
It is also possible to define your target platform based on plug-ins in your file system.
But this is not recommended as popular build systems like Maven/Tycho do not support file based target definition files.
