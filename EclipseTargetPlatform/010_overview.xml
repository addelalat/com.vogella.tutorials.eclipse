		<para>
			The set of plug-ins
			which you can use for your development or your
			build process to resolve the project dependencies is
			defined
			by the
			plug-ins in your
			workspace in addition with the plug-ins
			defined by
			your
			<wordasword>target platform</wordasword>
			.
			For example your plug-ins use classes from the SWT and JFace
			plug-ins.
			By default the plug-in installed in
			your
			Eclipse
			IDE installation
			are used as target
			platform.

		<para> A target definition file is typically shared between the developers to ensure that
			everyone is using the same
			basis for development.

		<para>It is good practice to develop and build against a specific
			target definition. This way it can be ensured that
			dependencies and
			their
			versions doesnâ€™t change during the development. Via an explicit
			target definition it can also be
			ensured that
			all
			developers in a team
			are
			using the same dependencies and versions,
			rather than being
			dependent
			on the
			versions installed in the IDE of
			every developer.
