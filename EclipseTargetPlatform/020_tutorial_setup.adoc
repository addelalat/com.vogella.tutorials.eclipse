== Exercise: Setting up a target platform

In this exercise you create a target definition which is used to develop an Eclipse RCP application.

=== Creating a project of type general

Create a new project called _com.example.rcp.target_ of type _General_ via menu:File[New > Other... > General > Project].

=== Creating a target definition file

Create a new target definition file via the menu:File[New > Other... > Plug-in Development > Target Definition] menu path.

Use the `com.example.rcp.target` as file name and press the btn:[Finish] button.

This creates a new file and opens the _Target Definition" editor.
Press the btn:[Add...] button.

Select _Software site_ in the following dialog.

Press the btn:[Next] button and enter the update site URL of the target release in the Work with selection box.
This is for example: http://download.eclipse.org/releases/neon for the Eclipse 4.6 (Neon) release.

Remove the _Group by Category_ flag and add the following components:

.Target components

|Component |Description

|Eclipse Platform SDK
|Components for RCP

|Equinox Target Components
|The native launchers for the platform, ensure to select
the non "black and white" entry if this exists. This entry is empty.

After you close this dialog, the target definition is resolved, which will take a while. 

[WARNING]
====
Avoid using the Eclipse IDE until the target is resolved.
Resolving targets is using the network and you do not want to interrupt this, as this might result in an inconsistent target definition.
====

After the target is resolved, press the _Set as Target Platform_ to activate it.
Please note that your version numbers might be different.

=== Validate setup

To check if your target definition is active, try to open the `IReconcilingStrategy`class via Ctrl+Shift+T (Open Type).
This should not be possible, as this class is not part of your target platform.

=== Solving potential issues for development

Your target platform depends on external update sites and the availability of the network.
Theses update sites might change over time, so you should be able to revert your target platform settings in case you face issues.

[TIP]
====
If you face issues with your target platform, switch to the IDE as target platform and afterwards switch back to your target definition. 

That sometimes solves target resolution issues.

[TIP]
====
If the target definition does not work, e.g. because of network issues,  you can use your Eclipse IDE as target platform via menu:Window[Preferences > Plug-in Development > Target Platform].
