=== Creating a target definition file
		
			Create a new project called
			_com.example.rcp.target_
			of type
			_General_
			via
			menu:File[New > Other... > General > Project]
			.
		

		
image::targetdefinitionproject10.png" />
				</imageobject>
				<textobject>
					<phrase>Create a project for your target definition file,pdfwidth=60%]
		
		
			Create a new target definition file via the
			menu:File[New > Other... > Plug-in Development > Target Definition]
			menu path. Use the
			<code>com.example.rcp.target</code>
			as file name.

			Press the
			_Add..._
			button.

				<textobject>
					<phrase>Add content to target definition file,pdfwidth=60%]
		
		
			Select
			_Software site_
			in the following dialog.

				</imageobject>
				<textobject>
					<phrase>Add content to target definition file,pdfwidth=60%]
		
		
			Press the
			<guibutton>Next</guibutton>
			button and enter the update site URL of the target release
			in the Work with selection box. This is for example:
			http://download.eclipse.org/releases/neon
			for the Eclipse 4.6 (Neon) release.
		

		
			Remove the
			_Group by Category_
			flag and add the following components:

			<table frame='all'>
		=== Target components
				<tgroup cols='2' align='left' colsep='1' rowsep='1'>
					<colspec colname='c1' colwidth="1*" />
					<colspec colname='c2' colwidth="2*" />
					<thead>
						<row>
							<entry>Component</entry>
							<entry>Description</entry>
						</row>
					</thead>
					<tbody>
						<row>
							<entry>Eclipse Platform SDK</entry>
							<entry>Components for RCP</entry>
						</row>
						<row>
							<entry>Equinox Target Components</entry>
							<entry>The native launchers for the platform, ensure to select
								the non "black and white" entry if this exists. This entry is
								empty.
							</entry>
						</row>
					</tbody>
				</tgroup>
			</table>

		

		After you close this dialog, the target definition is resolved,
			which will take a while. The result should look
			similar to the
			following
			screenshot.
			Please note that your version numbers might be
			different.

[[tuturial_targetplatform_activate">
=== Activate your target platform
		
			Afterwards press the
			_Set as Target Platform_
			to activate it. See
			<xref linkend="tuturial_targetplatform_solvingissues" />
			in case
			you have problems with your new target platform.
		
		
			To check if your definition is active, try to open the
			<code>SpyHandler</code>
			class via Ctrl+Shift+T (Open Type). This should not be possible.
		
	

[[tuturial_targetplatform_solvingissues">
=== Solving potential issues for development
		Your target platform depends on external update sites and their
			packaging of plug-ins. Theses update sites might
			change over time, so
			you should be able to revert your target platform settings in case
			you face issues.
		
		
			You can switch back to your
			Eclipse IDE as target platform via
			menu:Window[Preferences > Plug-in Development > Target Platform]
			.

		<note>
			If you face issues with your target platform, try switching to the IDE as target platform and afterwards switch
				back to your definition. That sometimes solves target resolution issues.
