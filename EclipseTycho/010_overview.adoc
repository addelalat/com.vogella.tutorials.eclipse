== Using Maven Tycho to build Eclipse components


=== What is Tycho?

_Tycho_ is a set of Maven plug-ins for building Eclipse components via the Maven build system. 
Tycho supports the build process of Eclipse plug-ins, OSGi bundles, Eclipse features and update sites (based on p2) and products.
Combined with a continuous integration server, e.g., a Jenkins instance, Tycho allows a continuous integration build. 
Tycho uses the Eclipse components metadata as much as possible. 
For example, Tycho  determines the dependencies of a plug-in via the _MANIFEST.MF_ file of the plug-in.
		
		
The main Tycho functionality is provided by the `tycho-maven-plugin` plug-in. 
This is a plug-in for Maven which supports building Eclipse components. 
It also enables Maven to understand package types such as eclipse-plugin, eclipse-feature and eclipse-repository.
		
If you add this plug-in to your Maven build file, the Maven build system downloads Tycho and uses it for building Eclipse components.
		


=== Configuring the pom files for a Tycho build
        
A Tycho build is configured via the standard Maven configuration files typically called _pom.xml_ or _pom_ files.

For a Tycho build, 
you typically have one pom file for the main configuration (_configuration pom_) and another one which includes the Eclipse components (modules) relevant for the build (_main pom_).

Every Eclipse component can have its individual pom file but Tycho allows also to generate default pom files based on the existing metadata of the compoments. 
This is based on the Maven polyglot functionality introduced with Maven 3.3.1. 
If the generated defaults, are not sufficient for an Eclipse component you can always define a specialized pom file for the component. 
        

=== Enable the generation of default pom files for Eclipse components
        
To enable the automatic determination of build information for your Eclipse components, add a _.mvn/extensions.xml_ descriptor to the root of your directory. 
This requires at least Apache Maven 3.3 and Maven Tycho 0.24.0.
        
The contents of the _.mvn/extensions.xml_ must look like this:


[source,xml,subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----    
include::res/polyglot/pomlesstycho-extensions.xml[]
----

The following rules are used for the automatic pom generation. 
First of all `.qualifier` from the Eclipse components is automatically mapped to `-SNAPSHOT` for the Maven build.
        
.Table Pom Properties Mapping
|===
|Property |Mapping

|packaging, 
|eclipse-plugin if MANIFEST.MF is found

eclipse-feature if feature.xml is found

eclipse-test-plugin if Bundle-SymbolicName ends with 
.tests

|groupId
|same as in the parent pom

|arifactId
|eclipse-plugin: Bundle-SymbolicName from MANIFEST.MF
                                
eclipse-feature: feature id from feature.xml

|version
|Bundle-Version from MANIFEST.MF or

Feature version from feature.xml
|===
        


=== Defining a specialized pom file for an Eclipse component
 
If you define a pom file for an Eclipse component, you need to specify the _packaging_ attribute in the pom file.
This attribute defines what kind of Eclipse component you are building.
For example, a plug-in must set this attribute to `eclipse-plugin`. 

.Table Package attributes for Eclipse components
|===
|Package Attribute |Description

|eclipse-plugin
|Used for plug-ins

|eclipse-test-plugin
|Used for test plug-ins or fragments

|eclipse-feature
|Used for features

|eclipse-repository
|Used for p2 update sites and Eclipse products

|eclipse-target-definition
|Target definition used for the Tycho build

|===
        
In addition to packaging attribute, the pom of an Eclipse component must also specify the name and the version of the component.
The artifact ID and version in the pom file must match the `Bundle-Symbolic-Name` and the  `Bundle-Version` from the _MANIFEST.MF_ file. 
Eclipse components typical use `qualifier` as a suffix in the `Bundle-Version` to indicate that this should be replaced by the build system with a build qualifier.
Maven uses "SNAPSHOT" for this, but Tycho maps these values correctly. Each `module` has again a `pom.xml` configuration file which defines attributes specifically to the corresponding Eclipse component, e.g., the package attribute. 

It must also contain a link to the main or the configuration pom so that the build can determine the configuration.

The following listing contains an example pom file for a plug-in.

=== Good practice for Eclipse components organization

To have some separation of the plug-ins a good practice is to have separate folders on the file system for them.

In a Tycho build it is good practice to create a configuration pom file. 
This file includes the Tycho plug-ins and the definition of the build environment. 
This pom file describes the general configuration.
The folder which contains this build file is typically releng for _Release Engineering_.
		
In addition you create an aggregator build file which lists all Eclipse components which should be built as _modules_. 
The aggregator includes the configuration pom file as parent.
		
And the pom files in the different Eclipse projects contain primary the nature of the component (feature, plug-in, product, update site) and the version number from the MANIFEST.MF.
		

=== Starting the build
		
After setting up your pom configuration files, you can build your Eclipse components with  the `mvn clean verify` command, 
or the `mvn clean install` command. 
It is recommended to use the `mvn clean verify` command. 
If the `mvn clean install` command is used, it would result in a build being installed in your local Maven repository and this can lead to build problems.
