== Tycho and the usage of a target platform

Tycho uses a target platform to find dependencies.
If you specify a p2 update site as target, the whole content of all defined p2 repositories becomes part of the target platform. 
If a target	definition is used in the project for development, the build should also use this instead of using a whole repository.
	
Tycho only supports Software Sites as locations.
The Directory Installation and Feature entries are not supported by Tycho and are ignored by the build process.
