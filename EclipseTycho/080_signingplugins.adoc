== Signing plug-ins

If the user installs plug-ins which are not signed, the user received a warning that the plug-in is not signed.
	
The Tycho build system allows to sign plug-ins and executables.
You can purchase a certificate from a certification authority or create your own signature and use this for signing. 
If you use a custom generated certificate the user receives a warning that the certificate is not official.
	
For testing a self-generated certificate is sufficient. 
You can generate such a certificate on the command line with the `keytool` from the Java Development Kit. 
This requires that the corresponding directory is in your current execution path.
