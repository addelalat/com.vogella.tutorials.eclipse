In this exercise you define the meta data to use pomless builds with Tycho. 
You also create the directory structure and the Eclipse projects to contain the main and configuration pom.

=== Create a new folder and create a root project in it
		
Select or create a new directory for this tutorial. 
In this directory, create a new project called _com.vogella.tycho_ via the menu:File[New > Other...>General> Project] menu entry.

This root project is supposed to contain all Eclipse components and the main pom file.
		


=== Enable pomless Tycho build
		
Create in the main directory (in the _com.vogella.tycho_ project) a _.mvn/extensions.xml_ descriptor. 
The content of the _.mvn/extensions.xml_ must look like the following to enable pomless builds.


[source,xml,subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----	
include::res/polyglot/pomlesstycho-extensions.xml[]
----



=== Create pom for the build configuration
		
Create a new folder called `releng`	in the main directory. 
In this folder create a new project of type `General` called _com.vogella.tycho.configuration_.

Create the following _pom.xml_ file in this project.

[source,xml,subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----	
include::res/components/parent/pom.xml[]
----	


=== Create pom in the root project
		
Create the following _pom.xml_ file in the root project of your build.
		
[source,xml]
----	
include::res/components/parent/rootpom.xml[]
----


=== Validate build setup

The created directory structure should look like the following.

Run the build via `mvn clean verify`, this build should be successful. 
No build artifact is created.
