== Exercise: Tycho build for plug-ins

[[exercisetychoplugin_overview]]

=== Target of this exercise
		
The following exercise demonstrates how to build Eclipse plug-ins with Maven Tycho.
		
[[exercisetychoplugin_pluginsfolder]]
=== Creating a folder for your plug-ins
		
Create a new folder called _bundles_ in the root project. 
This folder will contain your Eclipse plug-ins (OSGi bundles).

[[exercisetychoplugin_plugin]]
=== Creating a plug-in to build
		
In the _bundles_ folder create a new plug-in project called _com.vogella.tycho.plugin1_.

This plug-in does not require a pom file, the defaults from pomless are fine for this project.
		
[[exercisetychoplugin_bundlespom]]
=== Add pom for bundles directory
		
Create the following pom in the _bundles_ directory.
[source, xml]
----
include::res/components/parent/bundlespom.xml[]
----

[[exercisetychoplugin_rootbundlespom]]
=== Add bundle to root pom

[source, xml]
----
include::res/components/parent/rootpomwithplugin.xml[]		
----
 
[[exercisetychoplugin_build]]
=== Run the build and validate the result
		
To run the build on the command line from your root directory via `mvn clean verify`. 
In your _console_ you should see the BUILD SUCCESS statement.


Press F5 on your project in the Eclipse IDE to refresh it. 
You find a new folder called _target_ in your project which contains the JAR file for your plug-in. 
The created JAR file still has the SNAPSHOT suffix. 
This suffix is replaced with the build time stamp once you build a product or an update site with the `eclipse-repository` packaging type.

[NOTE]
====
You can also run the build from the _bundles_ directory or the directory of the plug-in.
This build should also run successfully.
