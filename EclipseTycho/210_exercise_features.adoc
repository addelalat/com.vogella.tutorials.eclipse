		<title>Run build build
		
			Select the root pom and run your build. This should work fine.

			Building the feature (from the features directory) will not work, as this requires com.vogella.tycho.plugin1 to
			be
			present in one of the repositories specified as dependency. If an independent build of the feature is required, you
			need to make the plug-in available via a repository, e.g., by building and installing the
			plug-in
			into the local Maven
			repository with
			<code>mvn clean install</code>
			.

		<title>Run aggregator build
		
			Select the pom of your aggregator and run the build. It should
			complete and
			build all your components.

	<section id="feature_validate">
		<title>Validate the feature build result
		
			Press F5 on your feature
			project to refresh it. You find a new folder
			called
			<filename>target</filename>
			in your project which contains the JAR file for your feature.
		
		
			The JAR file still has the SNAPSHOT suffix. This suffix is replaced
			with the build time stamp once you build a product
			or an update site
			with the
			<code>eclipse-repository</code>
			packaging type.
