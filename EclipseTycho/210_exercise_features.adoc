== Exercise: Tycho build for Eclipse features


The following description demonstrates how to build Eclipse features with Maven Tycho. 
It is based on <<exercisetychoplugin>>.
		

=== Create _features_ directory

Create a new directory called _features_ in your main directory.


=== Create feature to build

Create a new feature project called _com.vogella.tycho.feature_ in the _features_ folder.

Add the _com.vogella.tycho.plugin1_ plug-in to the feature.

=== Create pom for feature folder

Create the following pom in the _features_ directory.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/components/parent/featurespom.xml[]
----

The _com.vogella.tycho.feature_ feature does not require an separate pom file, as we can use the generated defaults. 


=== Add feature to root pom

[source,xml]
----
include::res/components/parent/rootpomwithfeatures.xml[]     
----

<1> Adds the features pom to the build


=== Run the build
		
Run the build from the main directory. This should work fine.

[source,shell]
----
include::res/exercise/feature/successmessage.txt[]     
----
		
[CAUTION]
====		
Building the feature (from the features directory) will not work, as this requires com.vogella.tycho.plugin1 to be present in one of the repositories specified as dependency. 

[source,shell]
----
include::res/exercise/feature/errormessage.txt[]     
----

If an independent build of the feature is required, you need to make the plug-in available via a repository. 
This can for example be done by building and installing the plug-in into the local Maven repository with the `mvn clean install` command.
====


Press F5 in the Eclipse IDE on your feature project to refresh it. 
You find a new _target_ folder in your project which contains the JAR file for your feature. 
Also this JAR file still has the SNAPSHOT suffix. 
This suffix is replaced with the build time stamp once you build a product or an update site with the `eclipse-repository` packaging type.
