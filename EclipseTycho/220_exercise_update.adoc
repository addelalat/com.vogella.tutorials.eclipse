<1> Adds the releng pom to the aggregator build


=== Run aggregator build and validate the update site build result
		
Run the build from your main directory. 
It should complete sucessfully and build all your components including the update site.

Press F5 in the Eclipse IDE on your update site project to refresh it. 
You find a new _target_ folder in your project which contains a _repository_ folder. 
This folder contains the update site.
