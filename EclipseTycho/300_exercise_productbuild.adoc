== Exercise: Tycho build for products


=== Target of this exercise
		
The following exercise demonstrates how to build Eclipse products with Maven Tycho.
It is based on the  <<exercisetychoplugin>> and <<exercisetychofeature>> exercises.


=== Creating a plug-in and the product project
		
Use the menu:File[New > Other...>Plug-in Development>Plug-in Project] menu entry and create a plug-in in the _bundles_ folder. 
Call this plug-in _com.vogella.tycho.rcp_ and use the _Eclipse 4 RCP application_ template.

Create a new project of type `General` called _com.vogella.tycho.product_ in the _releng_ folder.

Move your .product file from the com.vogella.tycho.rcp file into this new project.

=== Enter ID in the product
		
To build your product with Tycho, you need to enter the ID on the product configuration file.

=== Create poms
		
You do not need to create a pom file for your `com.vogella.tycho.rcp` plug-in as the default pom is sufficient.
		
Default pom for products are not yet supported (see https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=482487[Bug report]), therefore create a pom file for your product. 

[source,xml]
----
include::res/rcp/pom.xml[]     
----


=== Change product to use features

Change your product configuration file to be based on features.

=== Enable separate update of the custom feature
		
Open the product file and add `installMode="root"`for the feature. 
This allows to update the feature separately.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/rcp/com.vogella.tycho.rcp.product[]     
----	
		

=== Enter start-level in the product

To ensure that your product can be executed after the build, set the start levels and the auto-start flag for important plug-ins.
You can do this via the product configuration file on the _Configuration_ tab.
		
[source,plain]
----
include::res/rcp/startlevel.txt[]     
----    


=== Update releng pom

[source,xml]
----
include::res/rcp/relengpom.xml[]     
----    	

<1> Add the project with the product configuration to the build


=== Update bundles pom to include the new rcp plug-in

[source,xml]
----
include::res/exercise/rcp/bundlespomrcp.xml[]     
----        		

<1> Adds the rcp plug-in to the bundles build


=== Validate setup

Run the build and after the build you find zip and extracted versions of your product in the target/products folder.
