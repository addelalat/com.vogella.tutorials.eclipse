== Exercise: Tycho build for products with root files

In some cases it is helpful, if additional static files, like a readme.txt or logback.xml file, can be added to the built product. The easiest way to archive this, is to use root properties in the _build.properties_ file a feature project.

Tip: Further information about root file properties can be found here: http://help.eclipse.org/neon/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.pde.doc.user%2Ftasks%2Fpde_rootfiles.htm[Adding Files to the Root of a Build]

=== Adding a static file to a feature

Create a _readme.txt_ file in the _com.vogella.tycho.feature_ project.

=== Include the readme.txt file

To include this file into the product, the existing _build.properties_ file of the _com.vogella.tycho.feature_ project has to be adjusted by a root file property.

[source, properties]
----
bin.includes = feature.xml
root = file:readme.txt

----

=== Validate

Run the `mvn clean verify` command. Inside the built product should be a readme.txt file.
