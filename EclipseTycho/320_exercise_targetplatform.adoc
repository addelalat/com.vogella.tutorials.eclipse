== Exercise: Using a target platform for the build

[NOTE]	
====
This exercise requires that the target platform definition actually works for development. 
If you have compile errors after activating the target platform in the Eclipse IDE, it will also not work for the automatic build.
====
	
Create a new project of type _General_ in the _releng_ folder. 
This project should be  called _com.vogella.build.targetdefinition_.
Create in a pom file to your <code>com.vogella.build.targetdefinition</code> project.
	
[source,xml]
----
include::res/target2/pom.xml[]     
----        
	
Add the new project to your aggregator pom file

[source,xml]
----
include::res/target2/aggregatorpom.xml[]     
---- 	
	

Finally activate the usage of the target platform.
