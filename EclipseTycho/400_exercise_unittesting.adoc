== Exercise: Tycho build for test plug-ins


=== Target of this exercise
		
The following exercise demonstrates how to run unit tests with Tycho. 
It is based on the  <<exercisetychoplugin>> and <<exercisetychofeature>> exercises.
		
The tests of the implementation belong into a separate plug-in or fragment project.
We decide that our software tests should test the API defined by the plug-in, therefore we create a plug-in for the unit tests.



=== Adding the test dependencies

For testing usually JUnit is used, but also libraries like Hamcrest and Mockito.

Therefore they are added to the target platform by using the http://download.eclipse.org/tools/orbit/downloads/[Orbit] repository.

NOTE: The Orbit repository URLs do change quite regulary. Nevertheless the current one for Neon is http://download.eclipse.org/tools/orbit/downloads/drops/R20160520211859/repository/. 
In case this is not valid any more go to http://download.eclipse.org/tools/orbit/downloads/[Orbit] and look for the latest Orbit repository URL.

So for test purposes the target definition could look like this:

=== Create a new tests folder

Create a new _tests_ folder in the root _tychoexample_ folder.

Add the following _pom.xml_ file to the _tests_ folder:

[source,xml]
----
include::res/tests/aggregatorpom.xml[]     
----    

=== Create a new plug-in for the tests
		
Create a new plug-in fragment project called _com.vogella.tycho.rcp.tests_.

Define a dependency to `org.junit;bundle-version="4.12.0` and `com.vogella.tycho.plugin1` in its _MANIFEST.MF_ file.

The default are sufficient for this test plug-in, hence we need no separate pom for the test plug-in.


=== Create a unit test

Create the following unit test, as an example. 
Of course this test does not test anything real. 
It is only used to demonstrate how Tycho runs the tests.

[source, java]
----
include::res/tests/ExampleTest.java[]     
----	


=== Run the build with the tests
        
Run the build from the main directory. This should work fine.

If you want to skip the test execution use `mvn clean verify -DskipTests=true`
