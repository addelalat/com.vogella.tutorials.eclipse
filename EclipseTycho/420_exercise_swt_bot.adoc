== Exercise: Tycho build for SWTBot tests

The following exercise demonstrates how to run SWTBot tests with Tycho. 
It is based on the  <<exercisetychoplugin>> and <<exercisetychofeature>> exercises.
		
The tests of the implementation belong into a separate plug-in or fragment project.
We decide that our software tests should test the API defined by the plug-in, therefore we create a plug-in for the unit tests.

=== Adding the test dependencies

The dependencies for JUnit, Hamcrest and Mockito will be reused in this exercise.

The latest version of SWT bot can be obtained from this update site:
http://download.eclipse.org/technology/swtbot/releases/latest/

=== Create a new plug-in for the tests
		
Create a new plug-in fragment project called _com.vogella.tycho.rcp.it.tests_, where "it" stands for integration test.

Define a dependency to `org.junit;bundle-version="4.12.0`, `org.hamcrest;bundle-version="1.3.0"`, `org.eclipse.swtbot.junit4_x;bundle-version="2.3.0"` and `org.eclipse.swtbot.swt.finder;bundle-version="2.3.0"` in its _MANIFEST.MF_ file.

=== Create a unit test

Create the following SWTBot test.

[source, java]
----
include::res/swtbot/TestMenus.java[]
----

In the `@BeforeClass` method a static reference to a `SWTBot` instance, which will be used for all test methods, is created.

SWTBot needs a special test runner, which is applied by annotating the test class with `@RunWith(SWTBotJunit4ClassRunner.class)` for using the SWTBot test runner.

=== Pom file for SWTBot tests

Another difference for integration tests, like SWTBot tests, is that the https://eclipse.org/tycho/sitedocs/tycho-surefire/tycho-surefire-plugin/plugin-info.html[Tycho Surefire plug-in] has to be configured, so that the SWTBot test can run properly.

include::res/swtbot/pom.xml[Test pom for SWTBot tests]

=== Adding org.eclipse.equinox.event as extra requirement

In most of the cases the `org.eclipse.equinox.event` plug-in is used in an Eclipse RCP application. Unfortunately it sometimes is not loaded properly for an integration test, even though it is part of the target platform of the product and mentioned in the _start level configuration_. Due to this it needs to be specified in the configuration of the target-platform-configuration plugin.

[source, xml]
----
include::res/swtbot/target-platform-config-pom.xml[]
----

<1> Add the `org.eclipse.equinox.event` plug-in as extra requirement in the dependency resolution.

Also see https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=499587.

=== Add the SWTBot test to the build

The `com.vogella.tycho.rcp.it.tests` plug-in has to be added to the _pom.xml_ of the tests folder to take part in the overall build.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/swtbot/aggregatorpom.xml[]     
----

=== Run the build with the tests

Run the build from the main directory. This should work fine.
