== Automatic conversion of JARS to OSGi bundles

In order to convert JARS to OSGi bundles several solutions
exist.

=== Orbit receipts

The Orbit project hosts the Orbit receipts project which allows to convert JARs from Maven to OSGi bundles.
Clone the Git repo from the following URL Orbit Git repos (https://git.eclipse.org/r/orbit/orbit-recipes).
Afterwards see the
README.md for how to use it.
Also see https://github.com/eclipse/ebr for a description of the _Eclipse Bundle Recipes_ project.

=== General Eclipse metadata with the p2-maven-plugin

The p2-maven-plugin can be used to generate OSGi bundles out of JARs
and to create a p2 update site, which contains the converted OSGi JARs.

With the following build file `slf4j-log4j12` in version 1.7.10 and all of its dependencies are be converted to OSGi
bundles.
Also, a p2 update site is created.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/p2-maven-plugin/pom.xml[]
----

By using the `mvn clean p2:site` goal the following directory structure is created.

Here you can see that also `log4j_1.2.17` and `slf4j.api_1.7.10` are converted.
They can be used via the generated update site.

In this case the p2 repository targets the file system.
But of curse you can also embed the conversion into a deployment build.

In the following sample the p2-maven-plugin is added to the `package` phase and the `site` goal is executed.
Then the p2 updatesite is archived to one zip file, which is then uploaded to a repository manager.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/p2-maven-plugin/pom-scm.xml[]
----

If you are using an artifact manager like Nexus, you can `mvn clean deploy` and the zip file is deployed to it.


In order to use this p2 update site inside this zip file you can create a virtual repository on Nexus and use the
ï»¿_Tycho/Nexus Unzip Plugin_.

See https://wiki.eclipse.org/Tycho/Nexus_Unzip_Plugin[Tycho/Nexus Unzip] plugin for more information.

See http://projects.reficio.org/p2-maven-plugin for more information on the usage of the p2-maven-plugin.
