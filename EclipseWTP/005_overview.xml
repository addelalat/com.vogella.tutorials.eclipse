== Eclipse Web Tool Platform
	
		The
		_Eclipse WTP_
		project
		provides tools for developing standard Java
		web
		applications and
		Java EE
		applications. Typical web
		artifacts in a Java
		environment are
		HTML
		pages, XML files,
		webservices, servlets and JSPs.
		Eclipse WTP
		simplifies
		the
		creation these web
		artifacts and provides
		runtime
		environments in
		which
		these artifacts
		can be deployed, started
		and
		debugged.
	
	
		In Eclipse
		WTP you create
		_Dynamic Web Projects_
		.
		These projects
		provide
		the
		necessary functionality to run, debug and
		deploy
		Java web
		applications.
	
	
		Eclipse WTP supports all major web containers. This includes
		Jetty and
		Apache Tomcat as well as most Java EE application
		server. In this tutorial we use Apache Tomcat as the web container.
	
	The tutorial describes the creation of Java servlets. The usage
		of JavaServer Pages is widely seen as outdated, other frameworks are
		used for the creation of web user interfaces.
