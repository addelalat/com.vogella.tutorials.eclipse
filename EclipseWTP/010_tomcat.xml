== Tomcat Installation
	
		Eclipse allows downloading and starting a local Tomcat
		installation
		within the Eclipse IDE. Their is no need for an additional
		setup.
	
	
		If you have a local running Tomcat installation on your computer, stop
		Tomcat.
		Eclipse WTP needs to start Tomcat itself
		for its deployments.
