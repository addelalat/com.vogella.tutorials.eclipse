== SWT Designer (WindowBuilder)



	
		_SWT Designer_
		is a visual editor used to create graphical user
		interfaces. It is a
		two
		way parser, e.g., you can edit the source code
		or use a graphical
		editor
		to modify the user interface and SWT
		Designer will synchronize
		between
		both representations.
	

	
		SWT Designer
		is part of the WindowBuilder project. WindowBuilder
		provides the
		foundation and
		SWT Designer
		adds the support for working
		with SWT based applications.
		SWT Designer supports Eclipse 3.x and
		Eclipse 4 RCP applications.
