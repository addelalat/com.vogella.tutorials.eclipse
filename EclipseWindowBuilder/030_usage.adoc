== Using SWT Designer

SWT Designer allows you to open Java components in a special
editor. This editor can work with parts, SWT and JFace dialogs, JFace
wizards, etc.

SWT Designer
allows
to
drag-and-drop
SWT
components into an existing
layout,
change
layout
settings and create
event handlers for your widgets.

You can also use the SWT and JFace templates which SWT Designer contributes to the Eclipse IDE. 
For example you can use it to create `Composites` and add these to the Eclipse user interface. 
To create a new `Composite` select menu:File[New > Other... > WindowBuilder > SWT Designer > SWT > Composite].

SWT Designer
has excellent support to establish data binding
between your data model and your user interface components via the
JFace Data Binding framework.
