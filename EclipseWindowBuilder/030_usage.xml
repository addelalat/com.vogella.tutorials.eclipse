== Using SWT Designer

	
		SWT Designer allows you to open Java components in a special
		editor. This editor can work with parts, SWT and JFace dialogs, JFace
		wizards, etc.
	
	
		SWT Designer
		allows
		to
		drag-and-drop
		SWT
		components into an existing
		layout,
		change
		layout
		settings and create
		event handlers for your widgets.

		You
		can also use the
		SWT
		and
		JFace
		templates which
		SWT Designer
		contributes
		to the Eclipse IDE. For example you can
		use it to
		create
		`Composites`
		and add these to the Eclipse user interface. To create a new
		`Composite`
		select
		menu:
			<guimenu>File</guimenu>
			<guisubmenu>New</guisubmenu>
			<guisubmenu>Other...</guisubmenu>
			<guisubmenu>WindowBuilder</guisubmenu>
			<guisubmenu>SWT Designer</guisubmenu>
			<guisubmenu>SWT</guisubmenu>
			<guisubmenu>Composite</guisubmenu>
		</menuchoice>
		.

		SWT Designer
		has excellent support to establish data binding
		between your data model and your user interface components via the
		JFace Data Binding framework.
