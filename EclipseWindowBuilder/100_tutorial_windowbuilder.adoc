== Exercise: Getting started with SWT Designer

=== Installation

Install SWT Designer if you have not already done this. 
See <<swtdesignerinstallation>> for a description.

=== Building an user interface

Right-click on your `PlaygroundPart` class and select menu:Open With[WindowBuilder Editor].

NOTE: WindowBuilder uses the `@PostConstruct` method to identify that a class is an Eclipse part. 
This method needs to specify at least a `Composite` as parameter.

[source,java]
----
include::res/methods/PostConstruct.java[]
----

Switch to the _Design_ tab in the WindowBuilder editor. 
This selection is highlighted in the following screenshot.

Use SWT Designer to change the layout of the `Composite` of the part to a s`GridLayout`.
