=== Building an user interface
		
			Right-click on your
			`PlaygroundPart`
			class and select
			menu:Open With[WindowBuilder Editor]
			.
		
		NOTE:
			
				WindowBuilder uses the
				`@PostConstruct`
				method to identify that a class is an Eclipse part. This method
				needs to specify at least a
				`Composite`
				as parameter.
			
			
				<programlisting language="java">
					<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/methods/PostConstruct.java" />
				</programlisting>
			

		</note>

		
			Switch to the
			_Design_
			tab in the WindowBuilder editor. This selection is highlighted in the
			following screenshot.
