== Eclipse Wizards

=== What is a wizard

In Eclipse, a _wizard_ is commonly used for the creation of new elements, imports or exports.
It can also be used for the execution of any task involving a sequential series of steps.
A wizard should be used if there are many steps in the task, and they must be completed in a specific order.

Wizards are meant to take the hassle out of standard, repetitive, or tedious user tasks.
If a wizard is started, typically a new modal window is opened.
This window blocks the remaining user interface until the user finishes the task in the wizard or cancels the wizard.

The following screenshot shows the second page of a wizard.

TIP: JFace orders the buttons differently depending on the platform.

=== Wizards and WizardPages
The `Wizard` class from the `org.eclipse.jface.wizard` package provides the functionality to build custom wizards.
This class controls the navigation between the different pages and provides the base user interface, for example, an area for error and information messages.

A wizard contains one or several pages of the type `WizardPage`.
Such a page is added to a `Wizard` object via the `addPage()` method.

A `WizardPage` must create a new `Composite` in its `createControl()` method.
This new `Composite` must use the `Composite` of the method parameter as parent.
It also must call the `setControl()` method with this new `Composite` as parameter.
If this is omitted, Eclipse will throw an error.

=== Starting the Wizard

To open a wizard, use the `WizardDialog` class from the `org.eclipse.jface.wizard` 	package.

Typically, a wizard is opened via a menu or toolbar entry or via a `SelectionListener` on a button.

=== Changing the page order

To control the order of the `WizardPage` object, you can override the `getNextPage()` method in the `Wizard`.
This allows you to change the order of the pages depending on the data in the wizard and pages.

The following code snippet demonstrates this approach.

=== Working with data in the wizard

To use the same data in different pages of your wizard, pass them to the wizard pages via their constructor parameters.

The `isVisible()` method is called whenever the `WizardPage` either gets visible or invisible.
Call the `super.isVisible()` method and check the current status of the page.
If the page is visible, assign the data of your object to the user interface components.

=== Updating the Wizard buttons from a WizardPage

The `WizardPage` class defines the `canFlipToNextPage()` and `setPageComplete()` methods to control if the btn:[Next] or the btn:[Finish] button in the wizard becomes active.

The `Wizard` class defines the `canFinish` method in which you can define if the wizard can be completed.

If the status changes, you can update the buttons in the `Wizard` (e.g., the btn:[Next] and the btn:[Finish] button) from a `WizardPage` via the `getWizard().getContainer().updateButtons()` method call.
