== Exercise: Eclipse IDE Import Wizard

=== Target

Provide a wizard in the _Import_ dialog of the Eclipse IDE.

=== Implement an import wizard

Implementing an _import wizard_ is pretty similar to implementing a _new wizard_.

The main difference is that the _org.eclipse.ui.importWizards_ extension point and the `IImportWizard` interface has to be used.

Therefore almost every step from <<exercise-new-wizard>> can be adapted.

=== Validate

Optionally the two wizard pages from previous exercises can be added to this new wizard.

Start an Eclipse IDE and open the _Import_ dialog by using the menu:File[Import...] menu and choose the MyImportWizard wizard.
