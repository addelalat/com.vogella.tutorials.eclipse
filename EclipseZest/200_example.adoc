== Your first Zest Project

=== Getting started

Create a new Eclipse RCP application "de.vogella.zest.first".
Use
the
"Eclipse RCP with a view" as a template.
Add
"org.eclipse.zest.core"
and "org.eclipse.zest.layouts" as
dependencies
to your MANIFEST.MF.

Change the code of "View.java" to the following. This code
creates a simple graph and connects its elements.

[source,java]

"de.vogella.zest.first.handler.ChangeLayout" which will change
the
layout for the graph. Assign the command to the menu.

Run your application, if you select your command the layout of
your view should change.
