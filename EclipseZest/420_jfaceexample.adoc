== Zest and JFace Example

=== Create Project

Create a new RCP application "de.vogella.zest.jface".
Use the "
RCP application with a view" as a template. Add the zest
dependencies
to your MANIFEST.MF. Change the Perspective.java to the
following (we
do not want a
stand-alone view).

[source,java]
----
include::res/jface/Perspective.java[]
----

=== Model

Create the following model. Please note that the model can be
anything as long as you can
logically convert it into a connected Graph. 

[source,java]
----
include::res/jface/MyNode.java[]
----

[source,java]
----
include::res/jface/MyConnection.java[]
----

Also build this class which provides an instance of the data
model. 

[source,java]
----
include::res/jface/NodeModelContentProvider.java[]
----

=== Providers

Create the following content and label providers. 

[source,java]
----
include::res/jface/ZestNodeContentProvider.java[]
----

[source,java]
----
include::res/jface/ZestLabelProvider.java[]
----

=== View

Change the view to the following.

[source,java]
----
include::res/jface/View.java[]
----

The result should look like the following.

=== Filter

You can define a filter on the viewer via setFilters();

For example define the following filter.

[source,java]
----
include::res/jface/NodeFilter.java[]
----

Apply the filter to the view to filter all elements.

[source,java]
----
include::res/jface/ViewFilter.java[]
----

TIP: You can also define a filter on the layout so that certain
elements are ignore then calculating the layout. Method
isObjectFiltered(LayoutItem item). Use item.getGraphData() to get
the underlying object
(GraphNode or GraphConnection).
