			Eclipse Zest is a visualization toolkit for graphs. It is based
			on <ulink url="http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/SWT/article.html"> SWT</ulink>
			/ Draw2D. Zest supports the viewer concept from
			<ulink url="http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseJFace/article.html"> JFace Viewers</ulink>
			and
			therefore
			allows to separate the model from the graphical
			representation of the
			model.
			This article assumes that you are already
			familiar with
			<ulink
				url="http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/RichClientPlatform/article.html"> Eclipse RCP</ulink>
			or
			<ulink url="http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipsePlugIn/article.html"> Eclipse Plugin development</ulink>

		<title>Layout Manager</title>
		<para>
			Eclipse Zest provides graph layout managers. A graph
			layout
			manager
			determines how the nodes (and the arrows) of a graph
			are
			arranged on
			the screen. The following layout managers are provided:

		<title>Filter</title>
		<para> You can also define filters (org.eclipse.zest.layouts.Filter)
			on the layout managers via the method setFilter(filter). This defines
			which nodes
			and connections should be displayed. The filter receives
			an
			LayoutItem,
			the actual graph element can be received with the method
			getGraphData().
