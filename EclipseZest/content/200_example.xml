== Your first Zest Project

=== Getting started
		
			Create a new Eclipse RCP application "de.vogella.zest.first".
			Use
			the
			"Eclipse RCP with a view" as a template.
			Add
			"org.eclipse.zest.core"
			and "org.eclipse.zest.layouts" as
			dependencies
			to your MANIFEST.MF.
	

		Change the code of "View.java" to the following. This code
			creates a simple graph and connects its elements.
		
			<programlisting>
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="../examples/first/View.java" />
			</programlisting>
		
		 Run you application and you should see the graph.

=== Select layout manager via a command
		
			Create a
			http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseCommands/article.html"> command
			with the following default handler
			"de.vogella.zest.first.handler.ChangeLayout" which will change
			the
			layout for the graph. Assign the command to the menu.
		
		
			<programlisting>
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="../examples/first/ChangeLayout.java" />
			</programlisting>
		

		Run your application, if you select your command the layout of
			your view should change.
