== Zest and JFace
	
		http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseJFace/article.html">JFace
		provides viewers to encapsulate the data from the presentation.
		For an
		introduction to JFace viewer please see
		http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseJFaceTable/article.html"> Eclipse JFace TableViewer
		or 		http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseJFaceTreeViewer/article.html"> Eclipse JFace TreeViewer. A JFace viewer requires a content provider and a label provider.
		Zest provides as a viewer the class "GraphViewer".
		Content provider in
		Zest are either based on the connections or on the
		nodes.
	

	
		Standard Zest Content providers are:
		<table frame='all'>
	=== Zest JFace Content Provider
			<tgroup cols='2' align='left' colsep='1' rowsep='1'>
				<colspec colname='c1' />
				<colspec colname='c2' />
				<thead>
					<row>
						<entry>Content Provider</entry>
						<entry>Description</entry>
					</row>
				</thead>
				<tbody>
					<row>
						<entry>IGraphContentProvider</entry>
						<entry>Based on the connections. The connections contain the
							information
							which nodes they refer to. Cannot display nodes
							without connections.</entry>
					</row>
					<row>
						<entry>IGraphEntityContentProvider</entry>
						<entry>Based on the Node which
							contain the information
							about which
							relationship they have. These relationship are available in the
							label provider as EntityConnectionData objects. </entry>
					</row>
					<row>
						<entry>IGraphEntityRelationshipContentProvider </entry>
						<entry>Node based, the content provider defines
							getRelationShips(sourceNode, destinationNode) which determines
							the connections. The advantages compared with
							IGraphEntityContentProvider is that you decide which objects you
							return. </entry>
					</row>
				</tbody>
			</tgroup>
		</table>

	

	 As label provider Zest can use the standard JFace interface
		ILabelProvider
		(implemented for example by the class LabelProvider) or
		the Zest specific IEntityStyleProvider.
