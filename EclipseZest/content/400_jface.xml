== Zest and JFace
http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseJFace/article.html">JFace
		provides viewers to encapsulate the data from the presentation.
		For an
		introduction to JFace viewer please see
		http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseJFaceTable/article.html"> Eclipse JFace TableViewer
		or 		http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseJFaceTreeViewer/article.html"> Eclipse JFace TreeViewer. A JFace viewer requires a content provider and a label provider.
		Zest provides as a viewer the class "GraphViewer".
		Content provider in
		Zest are either based on the connections or on the
		nodes.
	

	
		Standard Zest Content providers are:

|Content Provider
|Description
					
				
				
					
|IGraphContentProvider
|Based on the connections. The connections contain the
							information
							which nodes they refer to. Cannot display nodes
							without connections.
					
					
|IGraphEntityContentProvider
|Based on the Node which
							contain the information
							about which
							relationship they have. These relationship are available in the
							label provider as EntityConnectionData objects. 
					
					
|IGraphEntityRelationshipContentProvider 
|Node based, the content provider defines
							getRelationShips(sourceNode, destinationNode) which determines
							the connections. The advantages compared with
							IGraphEntityContentProvider is that you decide which objects you
							return.

	 As label provider Zest can use the standard JFace interface
		ILabelProvider
		(implemented for example by the class LabelProvider) or
		the Zest specific IEntityStyleProvider.
