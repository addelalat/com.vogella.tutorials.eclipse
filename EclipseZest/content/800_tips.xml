== Tips and Tricks

=== Disable that nodes can be moved manually
		 By default the user can move the nodes in Zest. To disable
			this
			you have to extend the Graph. 

		
			<programlisting>
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="../examples/move/NonMovableGraph.java[]
----
		
		

		The usage is demonstrated in project
			"de.vogella.zest.movenodes".
