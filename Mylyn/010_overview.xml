			Eclipse Mylyn is a software component packaged with the Eclipse
			IDE.
			The idea of Mylyn is to integrate
			_tasks_
			into the Eclipse IDE
			and connect the current state of the
			Eclipse IDE,
			e.g. the
			_context_
			with such a task.
		

		 Software developers perform a variety of activities. They
			write
			source code for new functionality, fix bugs,
			write documentation,
			answer questions, attend meetings and much more.
		
		
			Developing software in the Eclipse IDE
			involves writing new
			classes or
			methods and modifying existing code.
		
		
			For example the
			procedure of
			fixing a bug may involve writing unit
			tests,
			refactoring existing
			code, reading and searching
			involved code
			and
			finally fixing the
			affected code. If the activity of the
			developer
			during this task is
			interrupted or if
			the developer has to work on
			another
			task, e.g. an urgent
			bug, he loses
			the
			_context_
			he built while working on the previous task, i.e. all the involved
			classes which he has opened in the Eclipse
			IDE.
		

		
			Eclipse Mylyn allows the developer to record his activities in such a
			task while he is working on it. Each task has a
			_context_
			which captures the involved classes, methods and the cursor position
			in the opened Java or text
			_editor_
			.
		
		
			When switching between tasks, the corresponding context is
			restored and the editors which belong to this tasks
			are opened and
			the others are closed.
		
		
			Mylyn
			can also filter information in the IDE. For example,
			the
			_Package
				Explorer
			_
			view
			can be set to show only the files relevant for
			the
			current
			task.

		
		
			This functionality sounds simple but helps finding the right
			information much
			faster during a task switch of the
			developer.
