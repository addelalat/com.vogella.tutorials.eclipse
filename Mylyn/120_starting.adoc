=== Activate a task
(((Mylyn,activate tasks)))
		
To start working on a task, select the

_context_
, Mylyn
filters the visible elements in the
_Package Explorer_
view.

You can remove the filter in the
_Package Explorer_
view
by
clicking the
_Focus on Active Task_
button
in the toolbar of this
view
. Afterwards
all files
are displayed.
		
If you open a file while having an activated task, this file
is
added to
the context of
the
task.

Once you have identified all necessary elements, you can
focus
again on the task to filter out the unnecessary elements.
		
If you have to switch to another task you simply can activate
it. The context of the task will be restored.

(((Mylyn,create task from Problems views)))
		
You can create a new Mylyn task from the
_Problems_
view
, by
right-clicking on a problem and selecting
