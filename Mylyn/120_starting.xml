			You can remove the filter in the
			_Package Explorer_

			by
			clicking the

			button
			in the toolbar of this
			view
			. Afterwards
			all files
			are displayed.
		
		 If you open a file while having an activated task, this file
			is
			added to
			the context of
			the
			task.

		Once you have identified all necessary elements, you can
			focus
			again on the task to filter out the unnecessary elements.
		
		If you have to switch to another task you simply can activate
			it. The context of the task will be restored.
