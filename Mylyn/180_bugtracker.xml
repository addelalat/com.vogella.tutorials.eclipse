		Mylyn allows connecting the Eclipse IDE to bug tracking software. Mylyn
		supports many bug trackers, e.g., GitHub,
		Jira
		or Bugzilla. If the bug tracking system supports that, you can also
		to share the task context with
		others via the
		bug
		tracker.
		For
		example, you can integrate Mylyn with the
		_Bugzilla_
		bug tracker system
		or with the issue system of the
		_GitHub_
		website.
	
	
		There are a huge variety of available issue trackers
		it is beyond
		the scope of this $book to cover all of them.
		Information
		about the
		integration with the different trackers can be
		found on the
		Mylyn
		homepage.
