== API definition of a plug-in

In the _MANIFEST.MF_ file a plug-in also defines its API via the Export-Package Identifier.
All packages which are not explicitly exported are not visible to other plug-ins.

All these restrictions are enforced via a specific OSGi `classloader`. 
Each plug-in has its own classloader. 
Access to restricted classes is not possible without using reflection.s
	
Unfortunately OSGi can not prevent you from using Java reflection to access these classes. 
This is because OSGi is based on the Java runtime which does not yet support a modularity layer.
	
Via the `x-internal` flag the OSGi runtime can mark an exported package as provisional.
This allows other plug-ins to consume the corresponding classes, but indicates that these classes are not considered as official API.
	
The following screenshot shows how to set a package as `x-internal` in the manifest editor.

This is how the corresponding manifest file looks like.

You can configure how the Eclipse Java editor shows the usage of provisional API. 
Such an access can be configured to be displayed as, error, warning or if such access should be result in no additional message.
	
The default is to display a warning message. 
You can adjust this in the Eclipse preferences via the menu:Window[Preferences > Java > Compiler > Errors/Warnings] preference setting.

You can define that a set of plug-ins can access provisional API without a warning or error message. 
This can be done via the `x-friends` directive. 
This flag is added if you add a plug-in to the _Package Visibility_ section on the _Runtime_ tab of the manifest editor.

The `x-friends` setting has the same effect as `x-internal` but all plug-ins mentioned in the x-friends setting can access the package without receiving an error or warning message.
