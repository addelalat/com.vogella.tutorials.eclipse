== Exercise: Data model plug-in

In this exercise you create a plug-in for the definition of your data model. 
You also make this data model available to other plug-ins.

=== Create the plug-in for the data model

Create a simple plug-in project (see <<simpleplugin>>) called _com.example.e4.rcp.todo.model_.

The following screenshot depicts the second page of the plug-in project wizard and its corresponding settings.
Press the btn:[Finish] button on this page to avoid the usage of templates.

=== Create the base class

Create the `com.example.e4.rcp.todo.model` package and the following model class.

[source,java]
----
include::res/datamodel/TodoSimple.java[]
----

NOTE: You see an error for your final id field. This error is solved in the next section.

=== Generate constructors

Select menu:Source[Generate Constructor using Fields...] to generate a constructor using all fields. 
Use the same approach to create another constructor using only the _id_ field.

WARNING: Ensure that you have created both constructors, because they are required in the following exercises.

=== Generate getter and setter methods

Use the menu:Source[Generate Getter and Setter...] menu to create getters and setters for your fields.

.Why is the _id_ field marked as final? 
[NOTE]
====

The _id_ is final and therefore Eclipse creates only a getter.
This is correct and desired.
We will use this field to generate the `equals` and `hashCode()` methods therefore it should not be mutable. 
Changing a field which is used in the `equals` and `hashCode()` methods can create bugs which are hard to identify, i.e., an object
is contained in a `HashMap` but not found.

=== Adjust the generated getter and setter methods

Adjust the generated getter and setter for the `dueDate()` field to make defensive copies.
The `Date` class is not immutable and we want to avoid that an instance of `Todo` can be changed from outside without the corresponding setter.

[source,java]
----
include::res/datamodel/getDueDate.java[]
----

The resulting class should look like the following listing.

[source,java]
----
include::res/datamodel/Todo.java[]
----

[[services_todo_tostringhashcode]]
=== Generate toString(), hashCode() and equals() methods

Use Eclipse to generate a
`toString()`
method for the
`Todo`
class based on the
_id_
and
_summary_
field.
This can be done via the Eclipse menu
menu:Source[Generate toString()...].

Also
use Eclipse to generate a
`hashCode()`
and
`equals()`
method based on the
_id_
field. This can be done via the
Eclipse menu
menu:Source[Generate hashCode() and equals()...].

=== Write a copy() method

Add the following
`copy()`
method to the class.

[source,java]
----
include::res/datamodel/Copy.java[]
----

=== Create a Tag class

The following `Tag` class is used to group `Todo` objects.

[source,java]
----
include::res/datamodel/Tag.java[]
----

=== Create the interface for the todo service

Create the following
`ITodoService`
interface.

[source,java]
----
include::res/datamodel/ITodoService.java[]
----

=== Define the API of the model plug-in

Export the `com.example.e4.rcp.todo.model` package to define it as API.

For this, open the `MANIFEST.MF` file and select the _Runtime_ tab. 
Add `com.example.e4.rcp.todo.model` to the exported packages.
