== Exercise: Create service bundle

=== Create a factory to access your service implementation
		
			In
			<xref linkend="dataservice_plugin" />
			you create two plug-ins. To provide the service implementation to consumers the best solution is to use
			http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/OSGiServices/article.html">OSGi services
			but to keep this description, simple we use a factory in this exercise.
		
		
			Create a new class called
			_TodoServiceFactory_
			in the
			`com.example.e4.rcp.todo.services`
			package. For this you might need the following tip.
		

		TIP:
			
				In its default configuration the Eclipse IDE hides parent
				packages if they don't contain any classes. During the
				specification
				of your class you
				can
				define the correct package. This
				is depicted in
				the following
				screenshot.

					</imageobject>
					<textobject>
						<phrase>Specify the package for the creation of a class</phrase>
					</textobject>
				</mediaobject>
			
		</tip>

		
			The class provides access to your
			`ITodoService`
			implementation via a static method. It can be
			considered to be a
			_factory_
			for the
			`ITodoService`
			interface.
			A factory hides the creation of the concrete
			instance of
			a
			certain interface.

=== Export the package in the service plug-in

		
			Export the
			`com.example.e4.rcp.todo.services`
			package via the
			`MANIFEST.MF`
			file on the
			_Runtime_
			tab, so that it is available for other
			plug-ins.
		
		NOTE:
			Please note that the
				Eclipse tooling does not support the export
				of empty packages. You
				have
				to create at
				least one
				class in the
				package
				before you are able
				to
				export it.
