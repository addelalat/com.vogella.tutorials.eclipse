== Tutorial: Using the Activator and exporting your bundle

In this exercise you create another bundle which uses an
`Activator`
. You also run it within Eclipse
At the
end of this chapter you will
also export
your bundle
to use it
later in a
stand-alone OSGi server.

=== Create a new Bundle

Create a new simple plug-in project
"com.vogella.osgi.firstbundle.internal" via
menu:File[New > Other... > Plug-in Development > Plug-in Project].

=== Coding

Create the following thread class.

[source,java]
----
include::res/firstbundle/MyThread.java[]
----

Change the class Activator.java to the following.

[source,java]
----
include::res/firstbundle/Activator.java[]
----

=== Run

Select your
_MANIFEST.MF_
file, right-click it and select
menu:Run As[Run
Configuration
]
. Create an OSGi Framework launch configuration. deselect
all bundles
except your de.vogella.osgi.firstbundle. Afterwards press the
_Add
Required
bundles_
.
This adds the
`org.eclipse.osgi`
bundle to your run configuration.

Run this configuration. Every 5 seconds a new
message is
written
to the console.

TIP: In case you are wondering in which folder OSGi starts you find it
in ${workspace_loc}/.metadata/plugins/org.eclipse.pde.core/<runconfig>.
This folder list the installed bundles via the file "dev.properties"
and set the Eclipse workspace as reference in the config.ini file
via the osgi.bundles=reference\:file\ statement. This way you can
update your bundles in the running OSGi environment directly without
any deployment.

=== Export your bundle

Export your bundle. This will allow you to install it into a
OSGi runtime. Select your bundle and choose menu:File[Export > Plug-in Development > Deployable plug-ins and fragment].
