== Running a stand-alone OSGi server

This chapter will show how to run Equinox as a OSGi stand-alone runtime.
In your Eclipse installation directory identify the file org.eclipse.osgi*.jar. This file should be in the _plugin_ folder.
Copy this jar file to a new place, e.g., _c:\temp\osgi-server_.
Rename the file to "org.eclipse.osgi.jar".
Start your OSGi server via the following command.

[source, console]
----
java -jar org.eclipse.osgi.jar
----

But running the osgi jar solely is usually not desired.

Therefore the org.eclipse.osgi bundle needs to be configured by a _config.ini_ file located in an _configuration_ folder.

In order to pass commands to the OSGi runtime from the command line additional bundles are required.

* org.eclipse.equinox.console
* org.apache.felix.gogo.command
* org.apache.felix.gogo.runtime
* org.apache.felix.gogo.shell

To start these bundles with the org.eclipse.osgi bundle the config.ini has to look like this:

[source, config]
----
osgi.bundles=org.eclipse.equinox.console@start, org.apache.felix.gogo.command@start, org.apache.felix.gogo.shell@start, org.apache.felix.gogo.runtime@start
osgi.noShutdown=true
eclipse.ignoreApp=true
----


[NOTE]
====
With this configuration the other bundles have to be located right besides the org.eclipse.osgi bundle.

With this setup the OSGi runtime can be started similar to this with the additional `-console` parameter:

[source, console]
----
java -jar org.eclipse.osgi_3.11.2.v20161107-1947.jar -console
----

Once started like this the OSGi console can be used, e.g., by using commands like `ss` to see the available bundles.

You can also use "install URL" to install a bundle from a certain URL.
For example to install your bundle from _c:\temp\bundles_ use:

[source, console]
----
install file:c:\temp\bundles\plugins\de.vogella.osgi.firstbundle_1.0.0.jar
----


[TIP]
====
You probably need to correct the path and the bundle name on your system. 
====

You can start the bundle with start and the id.

[TIP]
====
You can remove all installed bundles with the -clean parameter.
