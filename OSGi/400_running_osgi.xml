== Running a stand-alone OSGi server
	 This chapter will
		show how to run Equinox as a
		OSGi stand-alone runtime.
	In your Eclipse installation directory identify the file
		org.eclipse.osgi*.jar. This file should be in the "plugin" folder.
		Copy this jar file to a new place, e.g., c:\temp\osgi-server. Rename
		the file to "org.eclipse.osgi.jar".
	 Start your OSGi server via the following command.
	
		<programlisting>
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
				parse="text" href="./examples/startOSGi.txt[]
----
	
	You can use "install URL" to install a bundle
		from a
		certain URL.
		For example to install your bundle from "c:\temp\bundles" use:
	
		<programlisting>
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
				parse="text" href="./examples/installbundle.txt[]
----
	
	
		TIP: You probably need to correct the path and the bundle name on
			your system. </tip>
	
	 You can start then the bundle with start and the id.
