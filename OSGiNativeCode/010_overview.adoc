== Using native code in OSGI

OSGi provides support for resolving and loading shared libraries in Java applications. A plug-in
can
specify these
its
shared libraries dependencies and associated platform requirements in their manifest file via the
Bundle-NativeCode
header.
This
header value is then used when loading a DLL through the
`System.loadLibrary()`
method call.

While you could use native code without this header, its usage has two advantages.

* a plug-in does not resolve if there is no matching clause for the current platform. If you donâ€™t include the
optional specifier (the trailing asterisk), this avoids an
UnsatisfiedLinkError.
* OSGi resolves the library name, e.g., "mydll" to the appropriate DLLs for the platform,
and
manages
the loading
and unloading of the shared library

To make your native library available you have to load it via a call of
`System.libraryLoad()`, OSGi handles shared libraries lazy, e.g., it does not eagerly load them.
