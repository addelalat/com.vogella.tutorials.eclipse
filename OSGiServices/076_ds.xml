=== Defining services the declarative way

			The OSGi
			_declarative services_
			(DS) functionality allows you to define and consume
			services
			via
			metadata (XML) without any dependency in your source
			code to the OSGi
			framework. Alternatively you can also use annotations in your source code to generated this meta-data
			at build time automatically. This is supported as of Eclipse 4.7.
		
		
			The
			_OSGi service component_
			is responsible for starting the
			service (service component). For the
			service consumer it is not
			visible if the service
			has
			been created via
			declarative services or by
			other means.
			Service
			components
			consist of an XML description (component
			description)
			and an
			object (component instance). The component
			description contains
			all
			information about the service
			component, e.g.,
			the class name of
			the
			component instance and the
			service interface it provides.
			Plug-ins typically define
			component descriptions in a
			directory called
			_OSGI-INF_
			.
		

		
			A reference to the
			component description file is entered in the
			_MANIFEST.MF_
			file via the
			<parameter>Service-Component</parameter>
			property. If the OSGi runtime finds such a reference, the
			`org.eclipse.equinox.ds`
			plug-in creates
			the corresponding service.
		

		
			The following example
			_MANIFEST.MF_
			file demonstrates how a reference to a component definition file
			looks like.
		
		
			<programlisting language="bourne">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/ds/componentdescription.txt" />
			</programlisting>
		

	




=== Defining OSGi services with annotations
		
			Since Eclipse 4.7 the component
			description can be automatically created, based on annotations in the class. For
			this
			you must activate the corresponding setting in
			menu:Window[Preferences > Plug-in Development > DS annotations]
			.

		With this setting activated in the Eclipse IDE, the IDE will generate the require meta data (component file,
			manifest reference, lazy flag, etc.) automatically.

	

=== Other ways to define OSGi services
		
			The preferred way of defining OSGi services should be via annotations, as this is simpler.
			But
			you can also define the
			component definition file
			manually.

			The Eclipse IDE provides a wizard for creating such files via
			the
			menu:New[Other... > Plug-in Development > Component Definition]
			menu entry. This wizard also adds the
			`Service-Component`
			entry to the
			_MANIFEST.MF_
			file.
		
		
			On the first page of the wizard, you can enter the filename of
			the
			component definition file, a component name
			and the
			class which
			implements
			the service interface.
			In the editor you can specify the provided and required
			service on
			the
			_Services_
			tab. For example, the provided service can be found under the
			_Provided Services_
			section.

			For example assume that you want to provide a service for the
			_ITodoService_
			interface via the
			`MyTodoServiceImpl`
			class. A correctly maintained
			_component.xml_
			XML file
			would look like the following.
		
		
			<programlisting>
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/ds/component.adoc[]
			</programlisting>
		

		
			After the definition of the component your
			_MANIFEST.MF_
			file
			contains an entry to the service component.
		
		
			<programlisting>
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/ds/MANIFEST.MF" />
			</programlisting>
		
		
			OSGi also provides a low-level API for starting, stopping and
			tracking services. See
			<xref linkend="osgiapiservice_overview" />
			for a reference.
		
	


=== Required bundles
		
			To use declarative services the following plug-ins must be
			available
			at runtime.
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					
						`org.eclipse.equinox.util`
						- contains utility classes
					
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					
						`org.eclipse.equinox.ds`
						- is responsible for reading
						the component
						metadata and for creating and
						registering the services
						based this
						information
					
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					
						`org.eclipse.osgi.services`
						- service functionality used by declarative services
					
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
