	<title>Setting the start level for declarative services
	
		If you use OSGi DS services outside Eclipse RCP applications,
		you
		need to ensure that the
		<code>org.eclipse.equinox.ds</code>
		plug-ins is started before any application
		plug-in
		which
		wants to consume a service.
	
	
		You can ensure this in your
		launch
		configuration by setting the
		_auto-start_
		field to true and the start level lower than 4 (4 is the default value) for the org.eclipse.equinox.ds plug-in
