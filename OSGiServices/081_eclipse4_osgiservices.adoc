=== Using declarative services in RCP applications
(((Product configuration file,Start level)))

The Eclipse RCP framework automatically starts the required plug-ins for using declarative OSGi service.
It is not required to manually set a start level in your product configuration file.
	
A plug-in which provides service in an Eclipse RCP application must be in its `ACTIVE` life cycle status. 
Therefore, ensure that the _Activate this plug-in when one of its classes is loaded_ flag is set on the _MANIFEST.MF_ file. 
The DS annotation support in Eclipse allows that this is done automatically.
See <<declarativeservices_annotations>> and<<osgiservice_active>> for details.
