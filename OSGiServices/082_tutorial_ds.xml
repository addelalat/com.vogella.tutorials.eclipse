== Tutorial: Define a declarative OSGi Service
	 The following will define a DS service based on the quote
		example. It is therefore required that you have created
		the
		"de.vogella.osgi.quote" project which contains the interface
		definition.
	
	
		Create a new plug-in project "de.vogella.osgi.ds.quoteservice".
		Do not use a template, do not create an activator.
		Import package
		"de.vogella.osgi.quote" in MANIFST.MF on the tab
		_Dependencies_
		.
	
	
		Create the
		_OSGI-INF_
		folder in your project. Create a new
		component definition as described earlier. The implementing class is
		de.vogella.osgi.ds.quoteservice.QuoteService which provides the
		service for IQuoteService.
	
	Create the class "QuoteService" which implements
		the
		interface
		IQuoteService.

	 Open component.xml and select the tab "Source". The final result
		should look like the following.

	 Copy the "org.eclipse.equinox.ds*.jar",
		"org.eclipse.osgi.services.jar" and "org.eclipse.equinox.util*.jar"
		from
		your Eclipse/plugin
		installation directory into a folder, e.g.
		"C:\temp\bundles\plugins"
		and install the bundle into your
		OSGi
		runtime
		via.

	 Start the bundles manually so that declarative services are
		available.
	
	 Export your own bundle to "de.vogella.osgi.ds.quoteservice.jar".
		and install it via:
	
	
[source,text]
----
include::res/ds/servicedsinstall.txt[]
----
	

	 To check if your service was registered use the command
		"services". This will list all installed and available
		services.
	
	 If you stop / uninstall the old service provider and start the
		new one your service should be picked up by the
		consumer.
