== Tutorial: Using services via declarative services

Of course you can also define the consumption of services via DS.

Create a new plug-in "de.vogella.osgi.ds.quoteconsumer". Do not
use a
template, do not create an activator. Import the package
"de.vogella.osgi.quote" in MANIFEST.MF on the
_Dependencies_
tab.

Create the following class. 

[source,java]
----
include::res/dsconsumer/QuoteConsumer.java[]
----

TIP: Note that this class has no dependency to OSGi.

Create the
_OSGI-INF_
folder and create a new
_Component Definition_
in this folder.

This time we will use a service. Maintain the "Referenced Services".

Make the relationship to the
`bind()`
and
`bind()`
method by selecting your entry can by pressing the
_Edit_
button.

The result component.xml should look like: 

[source,xml]
----
include::res/dsconsumer/component.xml[]
----

The result MANIFEST.MF should look like: 

[source,text]
----
include::res/dsconsumer/MANIFEST.MF[]
----

Export your plug-in and install it via:
install
file:c:\temp\bundles\plugins
\de.vogella.osgi.ds.quoteconsumer.jar

"If you start the bundle now with "start id_of_your_bundle" you
should get the feedback that the service was set and one quote should
be returned
