== OSGi service low-level API

=== Using the OSGi service API

OSGi provides several means of declaring services. This {textselfreference} focus on the OSGi declarative service
functionality but it is also possible to use other means for defining services. These options are depicted in the
following picture. Blueprint and Declarative Services provide high level abstractions for handling services.

This chapter describes the API to work
directly with OSGi services but, if you have the option, you should prefer higher
level
abstractions as these
simplify the
handling
of OSGi
services.

=== BundleContext

Access to the service registry is performed via the
`BundleContext`
class.


A bundle can define a
`Bundle-Activator`
(Activator) in its declaration. This class must implement the
`BundleActivator`
interface.

If defined,
OSGi injects the
`BundleContext`
into the
`start()`
and
`stop()`
methods of the implementing
`Activator`
class.

[source,java]
----
include::res/context/activator.java[]
----

If you do not have an
`Activator`
,
you can use the
`FrameworkUtil`
class from the OSGi framework which allows you to retrieve the
`BundleContext`
for a
class.

[source,java]
----
include::res/context/getBundleContext.java[]
----

=== Registering services via API

A bundle can also register itself for the events
(
`ServiceEvents`
)
of the
`BundleContext`.
These are, for example, triggered if a new bundle is
installed or
de-installed or if a new service is registered.

To publish a service in your bundle use: 

[source,java]
----
include::res/service/register.java[]
----

Once the service is no longer used, you must unregister the
service with OSGi. OSGi counts the usage of services
to enable the
dynamic replacement of services. So once the service is no longer
used by your implementation, you should
tell the OSGi environment
this by:

[source,java]
----
include::res/service/unregisterservice.java[]
----

In the
`registerService()`
method from the
`BundleContext`
class you can specify arbitrary properties in the
dictionary
parameter.

You can
use the
`getProperty()`
method of the
`ServiceReference`
class from the
`org.osgi.framework`
package,
to access a specific property.

=== Accessing a service via API

A bundle can acquire a service via the
`BundleContext`
class. The following example demonstrates that.

[source,java]
----
include::res/service/getservice.java[]
----

=== Low-level API vs OSGi declarative services

OSGi services can be dynamically started and stopped. If you
work with the OSGI low-level API you have to handle
this dynamic in
your code. This make the source code unnecessary complex. If you do
not handle that correctly your
service consumer can keep a reference
to
the
service and the
service cannot
be removed via the OSGi framework.

To handle the dynamics automatically declarative services were
developed.
Prefer therefore the usage of
OSGi
_declarative services_
over the low-level API.
