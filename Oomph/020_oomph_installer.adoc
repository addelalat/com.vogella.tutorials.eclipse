In order to work with the previously mentioned profiles, one can switch to the _ADVANCED MODE..._

In the advanced mode a certain EPP can also be chosen and when pressing btn:[Next >] a certain profile can be chosen.

Out of the box the installer provides certain default categories containing different profiles, e.g., for _Eclipse Projects_.
But it is also able to identify user defined profiles like the _Vogella-Setup_.

Additional user setups can be added by using the green plus button besides the _filter text_.

Depending on the chosen profiles there will be some extra variables for the installation on the next page.

After the variables are configured properly the last wizard page will give an overview about the setup tasks.

Once btn:[Finish] has been clicked all the tasks will be processed and a pre-configured Eclipse installation will be started.
