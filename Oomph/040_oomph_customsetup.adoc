== Oomph custom setup


=== Using a new profile

Out of the box the installer provides certain default categories containing different profiles, e.g., for _Eclipse Projects_.
But it is also able to identify user defined profiles like the _Vogella-Setup_.

Additional user setups can be added by using the green plus button besides the _filter text_.

Depending on the chosen profiles there will be some extra variables for the installation on the next page.

After the variables are configured properly the last wizard page will give an overview about the setup tasks.

=== Creating a new profile

This requires that you install the Oomph installer into your Eclipse IDE.
You can use the update manager for that.

Select menu:File[New->Others...|Setup Project Model].
