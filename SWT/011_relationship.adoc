	<title>Relationship to JFace
	
		_JFace_
		is a set of APIs which builds on top of
		SWT
		and provides higher level
		abstraction APIs and commonly used
		functions.
	
	
		JFace
		extends the
		SWT
		API for certain uses case but does not hide it.
		Therefore even if you frequently work with JFace you need a
		solid understanding of
		SWT.
