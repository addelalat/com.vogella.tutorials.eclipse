== Using SWT in Java projects
	
SWT is not restricted to Eclipse RCP applications. To use it in normal
Java programs you have to add the
_JAR_
files, which contain the SWT
implementation for the corresponding OS,
to the classpath of your Java
application.
	
To use
SWT
in stand-alone applications,
you need to have the
SWT
library available. There are
several ways of doing this. You can
either
download the
SWT
library or create an Eclipse plug-in project and define
a dependency
in this project.
	
Download the
SWT
library
from the following URL:
http://www.eclipse.org/swt/.
	
This ZIP file contains a
_swt.jar_
file which you need to add to the
_classpath_
of your SWT
project.
