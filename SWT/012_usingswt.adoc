		SWT is not restricted to Eclipse RCP applications. To use it in normal
		Java programs you have to add the
		_JAR_
		files, which contain the SWT
		implementation for the corresponding OS,
		to the classpath of your Java
		application.
	
	
		To use
		SWT
		in stand-alone applications,
		you need to have the
		SWT
		library available. There are
		several ways of doing this. You can
		either
		download the
		SWT
		library or create an Eclipse plug-in project and define
		a dependency
		in this project.
	
	
		Download the
		SWT
		library
		from the following URL:
	

	
		<programlisting language="java">
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
				parse="text" href="./examples/links/SWT.txt" />
		</programlisting>
	

	
		This ZIP file contains a
		_swt.jar_
		file which you need to add to the
		_classpath_
		of your SWT
		project.
