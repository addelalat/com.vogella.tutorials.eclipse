== Exercise: Using the SWT library in a Java project

Create a new Java project called _com.examle.swt.widgets_. 
Create a new `lib` folder in your project.

Download the SWT library from the http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/[Eclipse download page].
Navigate to the download page of the latest stable Eclipse release and scroll down to the SWT binaries.
Ensure that you download the correct version for your Java and OS version.
If you use a 32 bit Java version you need also to use the 32 bit version of SWT.

Copy the `swt.jar` library and the `src.zip` file to the `lib` folder in your project.

Add the library to the classpath of the project.
Attach the `src.zip` source zip file to the library.
Use the btn:[Open Type] dialog to open the 'Shell' class. 
If everything has been done correctly you see the source code of the 'Shell' class.
