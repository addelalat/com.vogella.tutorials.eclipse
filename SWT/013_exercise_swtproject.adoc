== Exercise: Using the SWT library in a Java project

Create a new Java project called _com.examle.swt.widgets_. 
Create a new `lib` folder in your project.

Download the SWT library from the http://www.eclipse.org/swt[SWT website] and extract the archive. 
Ensure that you download the correct version for your Java and OS version.
If you use a 32 bit Java version you need also to use the 32 bit version of SWT.
Use the _more_ link to find the correct version (32 bit vs. 64 bit).

Copy the `swt.jar` library and the `src.zip` file to the `lib` folder in your project.

Add the library to the classpath of the project.
Attach the `src.zip` source zip file to the library.
Use the btn:[Open Type] dialog to open the 'Shell' class. 
If everything has been done correctly you see the source code of the 'Shell' class.
