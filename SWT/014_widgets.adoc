== SWT Widgets

=== Available widgets in the SWT library
		
SWT
widgets are located in the packages
`org.eclipse.swt.widgets`
and
`org.eclipse.swt.custom`. 
Widgets extend either the `Widget`
or the
`Control`
class. Several of these widgets are depicted in the following
graphic. This graphic is a screenshot of the
http://www.eclipse.org/swt/widgets/[SWT widget homepage].

While SWT tries to use native widgets as much as possible, it can not
fulfill all common requirements with the native widgets.

Therefore
some
widgets extend the capabilities
of the native platform.
These are
part of
the
`org.eclipse.swt.custom`
package
and usually start with the additional prefix
`C`
to
indicate that they
are custom
widgets, e.g.
`CCombo`.
		
Compared to the
`Combo`
class, the
`CCombo`
class
provides
the ability to set the height of the widget.
		
Another
example is
`StyledText`
, a class which provides
advanced features for displaying
text, e.g.
drawing a background.
		
Widgets from the package
`org.eclipse.swt.custom`
are
implemented in pure Java while widgets from
`org.eclipse.swt.widgets`
use native code. Custom widgets are not supposed to use
the
internal
classes of
SWT
as these classes may be different on
the various
platforms.
Every custom
widget must extend the
`Composite`
or
`Canvas`
class.
API compliance is
guaranteed only for these base classes.
		
If the new
custom
widget is supposed to contain other widgets, it
should extend
`Composite`.
Otherwise it should extend the
`Canvas`
class.
		
In this {textselfreference} the words "widget" and
"control" are used
interchangeable for user interface elements.

=== Memory management
		
SWT widgets are not automatically garbage collected. If you release
an
SWT
widget, you have to call its
`dispose()`
method. Fortunately if a container is disposed, e.g., a
`Shell`
, this container also releases all its children.
		
The automatic release does not work for Color, Cursor, Display,
Font,
GC, Image, Printer, Region, Widget and subclasses. All of these
SWT
objects need to be manually disposed. JFace provides a simplification
for this via its
`LocalResourceManager`.

=== Constructing widgets
		
SWT
widgets, except the
`Shell`
object,
are always constructed with a parent widget which
contains
them. This
is similar to AWT and different to Swing, where the
`add()`
method is used.
		
The second parameter of the widget constructor contains the
_stylebits_.
Depending on
the
provided
stylebits the widget
adjusts its look
and feel
as well as its
behavior.
Each widget documents the supported stylebits
in its Javadoc.

The possible stylebits are predefined in the
`SWT`
class.
If no
special style is required you can pass
`SWT.NONE`.
		
For example the following code snippet creates a push button.
		
[source,text]
----
include::res/start/push.txt[]
----
		
The following example creates a checkbox button. The only
difference is the usage of another stylebit.
		
[source,text]
----
include::res/start/check.txt[]
----

=== Basic containers
		
The
`Composite`
class
is a container which is capable
of containing other widgets.

The
`Group`
class
is another container which is able to contain other widgets but
it additionally draws a border around itself and allows you to set a
header for the grouped widgets.

=== Event Listener
(((SWT,Event listener)))
You can register listeners for specific events on SWT controls.
For example, a `ModifyListener` to listen to changes in a `Text` widget or a `SelectionLister` for selection (click) events on a `Button` widget. 
The following code demonstrates the implementation, it uses `SelectionAdapter` which is an implementation of the `SelectionLister` interface.

[source,java]
----
include::res/events/selection.java[]
----

`FocusListener`
is another
examples for such a listener interface.

TIP: The Listener interfaces sometimes contain several methods and
you
only want to implement one of them. For this purpose Eclipse
provides
empty
default implementations for these interfaces.
This
allows
you to
implement only the methods you are
interested in.
These
implementations follow the
naming convention:

menu:
_Name_
`Listener`
[
_Name_
`Adapter`
]

For
example
`SelectionListener`
has
the abstract class
`SelectionAdapter`
which pre-implements the methods of
`SelectionListener`.

If you want to add a listener to the whole application, you can use
the
`Display`
class. For example to add a global mouse listener use
`addFilter(SWT.MouseMove, listener)`. If you add filters to the
`Display`
you may interfere with existing listeners. Ensure to test your code
accordingly.
