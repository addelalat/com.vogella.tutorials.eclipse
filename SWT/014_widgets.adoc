			SWT
			widgets are located in the packages
			<code>org.eclipse.swt.widgets</code>
			and
			<code>org.eclipse.swt.custom</code>
			. Widgets extend either the
			<code>Widget</code>
			or the
			<code>Control</code>
			class. Several of these widgets are depicted in the following
			graphic. This graphic is a screenshot of the
			<ulink url="http://www.eclipse.org/swt/widgets/">SWT widget homepage</ulink>
			.

			While SWT tries to use native widgets as much as possible, it can not
			fulfill all common requirements with the native widgets.

			Therefore
			some
			widgets extend the capabilities
			of the native platform.
			These are
			part of
			the
			<code>org.eclipse.swt.custom</code>
			package
			and usually start with the additional prefix
			<code>C</code>
			to
			indicate that they
			are custom
			widgets, e.g.
			<code>CCombo</code>
			.
		
		
			Compared to the
			<code>Combo</code>
			class, the
			<code>CCombo</code>
			class
			provides
			the ability to set the height of the widget.
		
		
			Another
			example is
			<code>StyledText</code>
			, a class which provides
			advanced features for displaying
			text, e.g.
			drawing a background.
		

		
			Widgets from the package
			<code>org.eclipse.swt.custom</code>
			are
			implemented in pure Java while widgets from
			<code>org.eclipse.swt.widgets</code>
			use native code. Custom widgets are not supposed to use
			the
			internal
			classes of
			SWT
			as these classes may be different on
			the various
			platforms.
			Every custom
			widget must extend the
			<code>Composite</code>
			or
			<code>Canvas</code>
			class.
			API compliance is
			guaranteed only for these base classes.
		

		
			If the new
			custom
			widget is supposed to contain other widgets, it
			should extend
			<code>Composite</code>
			.
			Otherwise it should extend the
			<code>Canvas</code>
			class.
		
		In this $book the words "widget" and
			"control" are used
			interchangeable for user interface elements.

			SWT widgets are not automatically garbage collected. If you release
			an
			SWT
			widget, you have to call its
			<code>dispose()</code>
			method. Fortunately if a container is disposed, e.g., a
			<code>Shell</code>
			, this container also releases all its children.
		
		
			The automatic release does not work for Color, Cursor, Display,
			Font,
			GC, Image, Printer, Region, Widget and subclasses. All of these
			SWT
			objects need to be manually disposed. JFace provides a simplification
			for this via its
			<code>LocalResourceManager</code>
			.

		<title>Constructing widgets</title>
		
			SWT
			widgets, except the
			<code>Shell</code>
			object,
			are always constructed with a parent widget which
			contains
			them. This
			is similar to AWT and different to Swing, where the
			<code>add()</code>
			method is used.

		
		
			The second parameter of the widget constructor contains the
			<wordasword>stylebits</wordasword>
			.
			Depending on
			the
			provided
			stylebits the widget
			adjusts its look
			and feel
			as well as its
			behavior.
			Each widget documents the supported stylebits
			in its Javadoc.
		
		

			The possible stylebits are predefined in the
			<code>SWT</code>
			class.
			If no
			special style is required you can pass
			<code>SWT.NONE</code>
			.
		
		 For example the following code snippet creates a push button.
		

		
			<programlisting>
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/start/push.txt" />
			</programlisting>
		
		 The following example creates a checkbox button. The only
			difference is the usage of another stylebit.
		
		
			<programlisting>
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/start/check.txt" />
			</programlisting>

			The
			<code>Composite</code>
			class
			is a container which is capable
			of containing other widgets.

			The
			<code>Group</code>
			class
			is another container which is able to contain other widgets but
			it additionally draws a border around itself and allows you to set a
			header for the grouped widgets.
