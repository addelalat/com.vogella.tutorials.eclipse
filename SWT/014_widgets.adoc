== SWT Widgets

=== Available widgets in the SWT library
		
SWT widgets are located in the packages `org.eclipse.swt.widgets` and `org.eclipse.swt.custom`. 
Widgets extend either the `Widget` or the `Control` class. 
Several of these widgets are depicted in the following graphic. 
This graphic is a screenshot of the http://www.eclipse.org/swt/widgets/[SWT widget homepage].

While SWT tries to use native widgets as much as possible, it can not fulfill all common requirements with the native widgets.

Therefore some widgets extend the capabilities of the native platform.
For example, the `CCombo` class provides the ability to set the height of the widget, which the `Combo` class does not support.
These are part of the `org.eclipse.swt.custom` package. 
Such widgets classes usually start with the additional prefix `C` to indicate that they are custom widgets, e.g. `CCombo`.
		
Another example is `StyledText`, a class which provides advanced features for displaying text, e.g. drawing a background.
		
Widgets from the package `org.eclipse.swt.custom` are implemented in pure Java while widgets from `org.eclipse.swt.widgets` use native code.
Custom widgets are not supposed to use the internal classes of SWT as these classes may be different on the various platforms.
Every custom widget must extend the `Composite` or `Canvas` class.
API compliance is guaranteed only for these base classes.
		
If the new custom widget is supposed to contain other widgets, it should extend `Composite`.
Otherwise it should extend the `Canvas` class.
		
In this {textselfreference} the words _widget"_and  _control_ are used interchangeable for user interface elements.

=== Memory management
		
SWT widgets hold a holder reference to the native widget.
Such references are not automatically released by the system. 
If you release an SWT widget, you have to call its `dispose()` method. 
If a container is disposed, e.g., a `Shell`, this container also releases all its children.
		
The automatic release does not work for Color, Cursor, Display, Font, GC, Image, Printer, Region, Widget and subclasses. 
All of these SWT objects need to be manually disposed. 

[NOTE]
====
JFace provides a way to dispose such objects based on another widget, via the `LocalResourceManager` class.
====

=== Constructing widgets
		
SWT widgets, except the `Shell` object, are always constructed with a parent widget which contains them. 
This is similar to AWT and different to Swing, where the `add()` method is used.
		
The second parameter of the widget constructor contains the _stylebits_.
Depending on the provided stylebits the widget adjusts its look and feel as well as its behavior.
Each widget documents the supported stylebits in its Javadoc.

The possible stylebits are predefined in the `SWT` class.
If no special style is required, you can pass `SWT.NONE`.
		
For example the following code snippet creates a push button or a checkbox button, dependent on the passed style flags.

include::res/start/push.txt[]

[source,text]
----
include::res/start/button.txt[]

=== Basic containers
		
The `Composite` class is a container which is capable of containing other widgets.

The `Group` class is another container which is able to contain other widgets.
It it additionally draws a border around itself and allows you to set a  header for the grouped widgets.

=== Event Listener
(((SWT,Event listener)))
You can register listeners for specific events on SWT controls.
For example, a `ModifyListener` to listen to changes in a `Text` widget or a `SelectionLister` for selection (click) events on a `Button` widget. 
The following code demonstrates the implementation, it uses `SelectionAdapter` which is an implementation of the `SelectionLister` interface.

[source,java]
----
include::res/events/selection.java[]
----

`FocusListener` is another examples for such a listener interface.

[TIP]
====
The `*Listener` interfaces sometimes contain several methods and you only want to implement one of them. 
For this purpose Eclipse provides empty default implementations for these interfaces.
This allows you to implement only the methods you are interested in.
These implementations follow the naming convention:

menu:_Name_`Listener`[_Name_`Adapter`]

For example, `SelectionListener` has the abstract class `SelectionAdapter` which pre-implements the methods of `SelectionListener`.

If you want to add a listener to the whole application, you can use the `Display` class. 
For example, to add a global mouse listener use `addFilter(SWT.MouseMove, listener)`. 
If you add filters to the `Display` you may interfere with existing listeners. 
Ensure to test your code accordingly, your filters may interfere with your listeners.

== Colors in SWT

You can define colors in SWT.

[source,java]
----
Device device = Display.getCurrent ();
Color red = new Color (device, 255, 0, 0);

// Using system colors

Display display = Display.getCurrent();
Color blue = display.getSystemColor(SWT.COLOR_BLUE);
Color listBackground = display.getSystemColor(SWT.COLOR_LIST_BACKGROUND);
----

If you create non system colors, you have to call `dispose()` on them, if they are not needed anymore.
