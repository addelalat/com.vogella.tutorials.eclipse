== Positioning widgets

=== Manually placing widgets on a Composite

Controls must be placed in their container. 
You can manually define their position and size with the `setBounds` method.
This method allows to define the starting position and the width and height.
The coordinates start in the top-left corner of the containing `Composite`.

[NOTE]
====
`setBounds` defines both position and size.
You can also use `setLocation` and `setSize` to define the position.

=== The role of a layout manager

(((SWT,Layout manager)))
A layout manager is responsible for arranging the widgets of a container, e.g., a `Composite`.
SWT offers several standard layout managers. 
The following table gives an overview of them. 

.Layout Manager
[cols="1,2",options="header"]
|===
|Layout Manager |Description

|AbsoluteLayout
|Allows you to specify the exact position, the width and
the height of
components. As user interfaces may be
used on
screens
with
different
sizes this layout manager should be avoided.

|FillLayout
|Arranges equal-sized widgets in a single row or column.

|RowLayout
|Puts the widgets in rows or columns and allows you to
control the layout with options, e.g., wrap, spacing,
fill and so
on.

|GridLayout
|Arranges widgets in a grid.

|FormLayout
|Arranges the widgets with the help of the associated attachments.

|StackLayout
|This Layout stacks all the controls one on top of the other and resizes all controls to have the same size and location.
The control specified in `topControl` is visible and all other controls are not visible.

|===

If you assign a layout manager to a control you do not have to call `pack` anymore. 
The only case in which you need to call `pack`, is if a control has no layout.

=== Layout Data

Each SWT widget can have a layout specific settings class assigned to it, e.g., `GridData` for a `GridLayout`. 
This allows the developer to control the arrangement of the widgets dwithin the layout.

In the following example you specify that a certain widget should take two columns in a  `GridLayout`.

[source, java]

include::res/gridlayout/gridDataExample.txt[]
----

WARNING: The used layout data must match the layout manager, otherwise an exception is thrown at runtime.

The layout will be automatically calculated when the container is displayed. 
You can tell a `Composite` to recalculate its layout with the `composite.requestLayout()` method.

WARNING: Layout data objects should not be reused as the layout manager expects that every user interface element has a unique layout data object.

=== FillLayout

`FillLayout` divides the available space provided by the container equally to all widgets.
It can arrange the widgets either horizontally (`SWT.HORIZONTAL`) or vertically (`SWT.VERTICAL`). 
It also allows you to set the space between the widgets (attribute `spacing` ) and the margins of the widgets to the container via the `marginWidth` and `marginHeight` attributes.

=== RowLayout

`RowLayout` orders UI components in a row (`SWT.HORIZONTAL`) or in a column (`SWT.VERTICAL`).
`RowLayout` supports wrapping of fields (field `wrap`) by default.
Via the `pack` field, you can define if widgets have their preferred size (default) or if they  grab the available  space. 
It is also possible to set margins at the top, bottom, left and right.
If you set `justify`, the widgets will be spread through the available space.

Each element can define its height and width via a `RowData` element.

=== GridLayout

==== Usage
`GridLayout` allows you to arrange the user interface components in a Grid with a certain number of columns.
It is also possible to specify column and row spanning.

You can use `new GridData()` and assign properties to the new object.
Alternatively, you can use one of its richer constructors to define certain attributes during construction. 
For example, via the following constructor:

[source,java]
----
include::res/gridlayout/Constructor.java[]
----

The most important attributes are defined in the following table.

.GridData
[cols="1,2",options="header"]
|===
|Parameter |Description

|horizontalAlignment
|Defines how the control is positioned horizontally
within a
cell
(one
of:
`SWT.LEFT`,
`SWT.CENTER`,
`SWT.RIGHT`, or
`SWT.FILL`
).

|verticalAlignment
|Defines how the control is
positioned vertically within a
cell
(one
of:
`SWT.TOP`,
`SWT.CENTER`,
`SWT.END`,
`SWT.BOTTOM`
(treated the same as SWT.END), or
`SWT.FILL`
).

|grabExcessHorizontalSpace
|Defines whether the control is
extended by the layout
manager to
take all
the
remaining
horizontal space.

|grabExcessVerticalSpace
|Defines whether the control grabs any remaining vertical
space.

|horizontalSpan
| Defines the number of column cells
that the control will
take
up.

|verticalSpan
|Defines the number of row cells that
the control will take
up.

|heightHint 
|Defines the preferred height in pixels.

|widthHint  
|Defines the preferred width in pixels.

|===

If the widget has the `grabExcessHorizontalSpace` attribute set to true, it will grab available space in its container.
`SWT.FILL` tells the widget to fill the available space.
Therefore, `grabExcessHorizontalSpace` and `SWT.FILL` are often used together.

==== Using GridDataFactory

The `GridDataFactory` class can be used to create `GridData` objects. 
This class provides a convenient shorthand for creating and initializing GridData. 
The following listing demonstrates its usage and compares it with the direct usage of `GridData`.

[source,java]
----
include::res/gridlayout/GirdDataFactory.java[]
----

The Javadoc of this class contains several examples for it.

[NOTE]
====
Unfortunately the _SWT Designer  does currently not support `GridDataFactory`, hence the following examples avoid using them.
====

=== FormLayout

`FormLayout` works by creating `FormAttachments` for each side of the widget, and storing them in the layout data. 
The specific side of the widget is attached either to a position in the parent `Composite` or to another widget within the layout. 
This allows you to control on a very detailed level the placement of individual widgets within the layout.

=== Adding and removing children from a Composite

You can add children at runtime to a `Composite`.
By default, they are placed after the existing controls but you can reposition them via the `moveBefore` and `moveBelow` method calls.

To  remove a child from a layout, call its `dispose` method. 
To update parent composite after you removed or added children, call its `requestLayout` method.

The following is an example how to dynamically create new rows in a existing layout and how to remove these rows.

=== Triggering a re-layout of a Composite

As of Eclipse 4.7 you should use the `requestLayout()` method call on the `Composite` class, as this triggers an asynchronous layout call.

The `Composite` widget defines also the `layout` method which triggers a synchronous layout and should be avoided.
This method accepts also child widgets and flags. 
These flags should rarely be used in client code.

.Layout flags
[cols="1,2",options="header"]
|===
|Flag |Description

|SWT.ALL
|Flag forces all descendents to be marked for layout. AFAIK, there's no good reason to ever use this
flag.
If it's actually doing something, it could be replaced by a series of calls to requestLayout.

|SWT.CHANGED
|The flag causes subsequent calls to Layout.layout(...) to receive true for the second argument, which forces the layout to recursively flush all caches.
There's no good reason to ever do this.  If something changed, the layout should have been notified via Layout.flushCache(control) (which is what happens when you invoke
requestLayout). This is either a brute-force
workaround for a stale layout bug or was just unnecessary.
I can't
think of any circumstance in which we should keep
SWT.CHANGED.
