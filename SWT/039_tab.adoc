== Tab order of elements

The tab order is the order in which elements are selected when switching between them with kbd:[Tab â†¹].
You can specify the tab order of controls via the `setTabList()` method of a `Composite`.
For this you provide an array of the controls where the order of the controls in the array specify the tab order.

TIP: Defining a tab order for your controls is important to increase the accessibility and to allow advanced users a quick navigation.
