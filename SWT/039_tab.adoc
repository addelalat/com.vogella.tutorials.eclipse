== Tab order of elements

You can specify the tab order of controls via the
`setTabList()`
method of a
`Composite`. For this you provide an array of the controls where the order of the
controls in the array specify the tab order.

TIP: Defining a tab order for your controls is important to increase the accessibility and to allow advanced users a quick navigation.
