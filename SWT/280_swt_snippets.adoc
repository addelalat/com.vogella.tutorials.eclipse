== SWT snippets and examples
	
The http://www.eclipse.org/swt/snippets/[SWT Snippets] are examples for stand-alone SWT applications using different kinds of SWT widgets.
	
You can copy these snippets and paste them directly into a project with the dependency to SWT inside of the Eclipse IDE.
The snippet contains a main method which allows it be started.

[TIP]
====
You can paste classes from the clipboard onto a project or package.
Eclipse automatically creates the Java class based on the content of the clipboard for you.
====

The http://www.eclipse.org/swt/examples.php[SWT Examples] page provides useful programs that are written in SWT.
These are typically much larger and more comprehensive than the SWT Snippets.
