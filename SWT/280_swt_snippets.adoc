	<title>SWT snippets and examples


	
		The
		_SWT Snippets_
		are examples for
		stand-alone
		SWT
		applications using different kinds of
		SWT widgets.
		The SWT snippet site
		is located at the following URL:
		http://www.eclipse.org/swt/snippets/.
	
	
		You can copy these snippets and paste them directly into a Java
		package inside of the Eclipse IDE.
		Eclipse automatically creates the
		Java class
		based on the content of the clipboard for
		you.
	
	
		If you do this on a project which has
		SWT
		already available, the
		snippet can be started immediately.
	
	
		The
		http://www.eclipse.org/swt/examples.php">SWT Examples
		page
		provides useful programs that are written in
		SWT. These are
		typically much larger and more comprehensive than the SWT
		Snippets.
