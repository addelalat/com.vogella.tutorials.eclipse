		_SWTBot_
		is an Eclipse
		project which supports testing the user
		interface of an
		SWT based application.
	
	
		SWTBot provides an API
		which allows you to interact with
		the
		user
		interface of the application
		and to validate certain
		conditions
		on the
		user interface.
	
	
		The Eclipse or SWT
		application is started and
		controlled by
		SWTBot.
	
	
		If SWTBot is used to test
		Eclipse based applications, you need to run
		the JUnit
		test with a
		_JUnit Plug-in Test_
		run configuration.
		A JUnit plug-in test
		allows you
		to
		start and test
		Eclipse bundles.
