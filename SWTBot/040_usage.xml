	<title>SWTBot API
	
		`SWTBot`
		is the base class for testing SWT applications.
	

	
		The
		`SWTWorkbenchBot`
		class provides API to interact with
		Eclipse 3.x applications.
		The
		`SWTWorkbenchBot`
		class extends
		`SWTBot`
		. To test Eclipse 4.x RCP application you use the
		`SWTBot`
		class.
	
	 An user interface interaction may take some time, e.g., if the
		application
		reads some data. Therefore SWTBot waits, by default, 5
		seconds
		before throwing
		an
		exception. You can
		change the
		timeout via the
		following:
	

	
		<programlisting language="java">
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
				parse="text" href="./examples/api/timeout.txt" />
		</programlisting>
	

	
		For details on the API usage please see
		http://wiki.eclipse.org/SWTBot/UsersGuide">SWTBot wiki
		.
	
	<note>
		The support for Eclipse 4 RCP application is at the time of this
			writing fairly new. Therefore this chapter is intentionally
			short, as
			improvements and changes are expected in the
			future. Please
			see the
			project homepage for the most recent information.

	<warning>
		
			Testing an application with a login screen is currently not supported
			by SWTBot. See
