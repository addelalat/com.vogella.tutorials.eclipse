	<title>Waiting for certain conditions

	During UI tests there may be longer operations, which makes it necessary to wait until a
		certain condition is fulfilled.
	Therefore a `SWTBot` contains different overloaded methods like
			`waitUntil`, `waitWhile` and
		`waitUntilWidgetAppears`.
	All these methods expect an instance of the `ICondition` interface, where the
		condition for the wait operation is specified.
	The following snippet showns how such a condition can be defined for
			`waitUntil` and `waitWhile`:

	
		<programlisting language="java">
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/wait/custom_icondition.java"/>
		</programlisting>
	
	Fortunately `IConditions` for the most use cases are predefined by the SWTBot
		framework.
	 For 3.x application the `org.eclipse.swtbot.eclipse.finder.waits.Conditions`
		class and for E4 applications the `org.eclipse.swtbot.e4.finder.waits.Conditions`
		class can be used. Both classes are derived from
			`org.eclipse.swtbot.swt.finder.waits.Conditions`, which contains general SWT
		conditions.
	
		<programlisting language="java">
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/wait/table_row_condition.java"/>
		</programlisting>
	
	The `Conditions` classes also contain lots of generalized methods, which expect
			`org.hamcrest.Matcher&lt;T&gt;` instances in order to test a
		condition.
	General `org.hamcrest.Matcher&lt;T&gt;` objects for those
			`Conditions` are:

			</imageobject>
		</mediaobject>
	
	An example for the `WithText&lt;T&gt;` matcher is to wait for a
			`Shell`:
