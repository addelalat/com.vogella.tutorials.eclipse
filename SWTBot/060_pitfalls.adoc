== Possible pitfalls with SWTBot
This section contains possible pitfalls, which might come up when implementing SWTBot tests.

=== Accessing a Link and clicking on it
First of all define a `org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Link` to be tested in the UI code.

[source,java]
----
include::res/pitfalls/swt_link.java[]
----

So the text applied to the `Link` is `<a>www.vogella.com</a>`, but in the UI you'll see this:

image::vogella_SWT_Link.png[pdfwidth=60%]

When this `Link` should now be accessed by the `SWTBot` using the text of this `Link`, `<a>www.vogella.com</a>`	has to be used.

[source,java]
----
include::res/pitfalls/access_swt_link.java[]
----

Another pitfall concerning a `SWTBotLink` is that invoking the `click()` might not work properly. 
Therefore the `SWTBotLink` also provides an overloaded version of the `click()` method with a `String` parameter, which contains the hyperlink text.

[source,java]
----
include::res/pitfalls/click_swt_link.java[]
----

So the `click(String hyperlinkText)` method should always be used rather than just the simple `click()` method.
