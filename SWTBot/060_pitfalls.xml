== Possible pitfalls with SWTBot
	This section contains possible pitfalls, which might come up when implementing SWTBot
		tests.
	<section>
=== Accessing a Link and clicking on it
		First of all define a `org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Link` to be tested in the UI
			code.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/pitfalls/swt_link.java"/>
			</programlisting>
		
		So the text applied to the `Link` is
				<property>&lt;a>www.vogella.com&lt;/a></property>, but in the UI you'll see
			this:
		
image::vogella_SWT_Link.png"/>
				</imageobject>
			</mediaobject>
		
		When this `Link` should now be accessed by the `SWTBot` using
			the text of this `Link`, <property>&lt;a>www.vogella.com&lt;/a></property>
			has to be used.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/pitfalls/access_swt_link.java"/>
			</programlisting>
		
		Another pitfall concerning a `SWTBotLink` is that invoking the
				`click()` might not work properly. Therefore the `SWTBotLink`
			also provides an overloaded version of the `click()` method with a
				`String` parameter, which contains the hyperlink text.

[source,java]
----
include::res/pitfalls/click_swt_link.java"/>
			</programlisting>
		
		So the `click(String hyperlinkText)` method should always be used rather than just the simple `click()` method.
