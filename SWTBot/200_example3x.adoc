== Tutorial: Test Eclipse 3.x RCP applications

=== Create project
		
Create a new Eclipse RCP application called _de.vogella.swtbot.app_ based on the _Eclipse application with a view_ template.
		
Change the `View` class  to the following.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/first/View.java[]
----
		
		
This view defines two text fields, one of them will be identified by SWTBot via the label and the other through an SWTBot specific ID.

=== Create test plug-in
		
Create another Eclipse plug-in called _de.vogella.swtbot.tests_.
		
Add the following dependencies to the _MANIFEST.MF_ file for your test project.

* org.eclipse.ui
* org.junit4
* org.hamcrest
* org.eclipse.swtbot.swt.finder
* org.eclipse.swtbot.eclipse.finder
		
Create the following class which defines the JUnit test.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/first/UserInterfaceTester1.java[]
----
		
Right-click on the test and select menu:Run As [SWTBot Test]. 
In the launch configuration select your application and add the _de.vogella.swtbot.tests_ and _de.vogella.swtbot.app_ plugins and their dependencies to the launch configuration.

If everything runs correctly, you should get a green test.
Change your `test()` method to the following to do some real testing.
		
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/first/UserInterfaceTester.java[]
----
		
Run your test again and verify that the test run successfully. 

Change, for example, the content of one text field, re-run the test and verify that the test fails.
