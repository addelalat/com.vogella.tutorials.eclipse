	 SWTBot can
		automatically generate screenshots of the running
		application if a test fails. To
		use
		this feature include the plug-in _org.eclipse.swtbot.junit4_x_ into
		the
		dependencies of your test
		project. Annotate your class test with
		`@RunWith(SWTBotJunit4ClassRunner.class)`. This will automatically
		generated screenshots in the <filename>screenshots</filename> folder or your test
		projects. If you do not see this
		folder in your project, try refreshing
		the project (F5).
	

	
		You can trigger
		a screenshot in your code via the method
		`bot.captureScreenshot(fileName)`.
