== SWT custom drawing

The  'org.eclipse.swt.graphics.GC' class is a graphics context (GC) which encapsulates the drawing operations.
The SWT drawing API including for example how to draw lines and shapes, draw text and images and fill shapes. 
Graphics can be drawn on anything that implements 'org.eclipse.swt.graphics.Drawable'.
This includes 'org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Control' and 'org.eclipse.swt.graphics.Image'. 

There are two ways to use a GC:

* Create one using the constructor which expects a `Drawable` instance
* Register a paint listener on a control and use the gc return in the paintEvent callback
