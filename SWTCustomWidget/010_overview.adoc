==  Custom Widgets in SWT

In general a custom widget is an UI element, which offers a certain functionality in the UI, which none of the standard widgets can deliver.
In some cases the standard SWT widgets, which are delivered by the Eclipse SDK are not sufficient for a certain use case.

The most famous source to find custom widgets is the Eclipse project called Nebula (https://eclipse.org/nebula).
Here you find several useful custom SWT widgets. 
Another resource of several custom SWT widgets is the Opal project (https://github.com/lcaron/opal).
Also the Eclipse SDK itself delivers some custom SWT widgets in the `org.eclipse.swt.custom` package, like `CLabel`, `CCombo`, `StyledText` and others.

Custom SWT widgets are usually created by extending a `Composite`, a `Canvas` or one of their subclasses, because those implementations are portable to other platforms and therefore a lot easier to maintain.
