==  Custom Widgets in SWT

In some cases the standard SWT widgets are not sufficient for a certain use case.
A custom widget is an UI element, which offers functionality, which none of the widgets based on the native ones can deliver.
The Eclipse project itself delivers several custom SWT widgets in the `org.eclipse.swt.custom` package, like `CLabel`, `CCombo`, `StyledText` and others.

The most famous source to find custom widgets is the Eclipse project called Nebula (https://eclipse.org/nebula).
Another resource of several custom SWT widgets is the Opal project (https://github.com/lcaron/opal).

Custom SWT widgets are usually created by extending a `Composite`, a `Canvas` or one of their subclasses and be developed in pure Java.
In this case implementations are portable to other platforms and therefore a lot easier to maintain.
