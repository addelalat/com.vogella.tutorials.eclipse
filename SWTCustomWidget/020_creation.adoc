== Creating custom widgets
There are three common approaches to create a custom SWT widget:

* Compound custom widgets, which contain other existing widgets (`Composite`)
* Custom basic widgets, which have no children and we simply draw on (`Canvas`)
* Mixing both (`Composite` and `Canvas`)

[NOTE]
====
As a rule for creating custom SWT widgets, you subclass `Composite` for compound widgets and subclass `Canvas` in case the widget should not have any children.
