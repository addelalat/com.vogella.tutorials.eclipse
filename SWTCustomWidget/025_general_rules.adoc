== General rules for custom widgets

Some general rules have to be considered, when developing custom widgets, no matter which kind of custom widget is implemented.

=== System resources must be disposed correctly

In case of self drawn widgets you generally need a lot of different system resources, like colors, fonts or images.
These resources  have to be disposed correctly.
You can attach a `﻿DisposeListener` to your custom widget by using the `﻿addDisposeListener()` method of the `Canvas` or
`Composite`.
In this listener you can dispose the system resources, which have been used by the widget. 
If you also use the JFace plug-ins in your application, you can the `LocalResourceManager` class for handling system resources.

[WARNING]
====
You must _never_ override the `dispose()` method of the `Canvas` or `Composite` in order to dispose your system resources.You _must_ always add a `DisposeListener` instead, so that the actual disposal can be handled by the framework itself.
====

=== Fail fast
You should always invoke the `checkWidget` method, before it calls any functionality of the custom widget. 
The `checkWidget` method of the `Widget` class checks pre-conditions for the proper use of a `Widget`.
This involved whether the widget is not disposed and not accessed from an other `Thread` than the SWT `Thread`.

=== Tell others how big you are

By implementing the `computeSize` method you give `Layout` classes or other widgets the option to determine the size of your custom widget.
In this case the `Layout`, of the parent `Composite`, is be able to align its child widgets properly.

=== Use SWT errors

In case errors occur inside your custom widget, you should use one of the three static error methods of the `SWT` class.

* `public static void error (int code)`
* `public static void error (int code, Throwable throwable)`
* `public static void error (int code, Throwable throwable, String detail)`

The _code_ parameter of each `error` method must be one of the `SWT.ERROR_*` constants.
In case a parameter of a method must not be null, you can check this parameter and call `SWT.error(SWT.ERROR_NULL_ARGUMENT)` if it is `null`.

[NOTE]
====
Also have a look at the other `SWT.ERROR_*` constants, which can be used. 
They are all described in detail in the JavaDoc.
====

=== Also support ﻿bi-directional behavior

The `SWT` class contains two style flags, which can be passed to a widgets' constructor, where you can define the Bi-directional behavior of a widget.
`﻿SWT.RIGHT_TO_LEFT` is used to write the widgets text and other included elements from right to left.
`﻿SWT.LEFT_TO_RIGHT` is the default for most widgets.
