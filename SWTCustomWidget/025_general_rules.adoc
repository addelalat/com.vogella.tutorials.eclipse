== General rules for custom widgets

Some general rules have to be considered, when developing custom widgets, no matter which
kind of custom widget is implemented.

=== System resources must be disposed correctly

In case of self drawn widgets you generally need a lot of different system resources,
like colors, fonts or images, which have to be disposed correctly.
You can attach a `﻿DisposeListener` to your custom widget by using the
`﻿addDisposeListener()` method of the `Canvas` or
`Composite` and dispose the system resources, which have been used by the
widget. But in case you also use the JFace plug-ins in your application we suggest using
a `LocalResourceManager` for handling system resources.

[WARNING]
====
You must _never_ override the `dispose()` method of the
`Canvas` or `Composite` in order to dispose your
system resources. You _must_ always add a
`DisposeListener` instead, so that the actual disposal can be
handled by the framework itself.
====

=== Fail fast
To fail fast means that the public API of your custom widget should always invoke the
`checkWidget` method, before it calls any functionality of the custom
widget. The `checkWidget` method of the `Widget` class checks
certain pre-conditions for the proper use of a `Widget`, like checking
whether the widget is not disposed and not accessed from an other `Thread`
than the SWT `Thread`.

=== Tell others how big you are

By overriding the `computeSize` method you give a `Layout` and other widgets around your custom widget the chance to get to know the size of your custom widget.
By offering the size the `Layout`, of the parent `Composite`, will be able to align its child widgets properly.

=== Use SWT errors

In case errors occur inside your custom widget, you should use one of the three static
error methods of the `SWT` class.

* `public static void error (int code)`
* `public static void error (int code, Throwable throwable)`
* `public static void error (int code, Throwable throwable, String detail)`

The _code_ parameter of each `error` method must be one of
the `SWT.ERROR_*` constants.
In case a parameter of a method must not be null you can check this parameter and call
`SWT.error(SWT.ERROR_NULL_ARGUMENT)` in case this parameter is
`null`.

[NOTE]
====
Also have a look at the other `SWT.ERROR_*` constants, which can be
used. They are all described in detail in the JavaDoc.
====

=== Also support ﻿bi-directional behavior

The `SWT` class contains two style flags, which can be passed to a widgets'
constructor, where you can define the Bi-directional behavior of a widget.
`﻿SWT.RIGHT_TO_LEFT` is used to write the widgets text and other included
elements from right to left.`﻿SWT.LEFT_TO_RIGHT` is the default for most
widgets and is used to write the widgets' text and other included elements from left to
right.
