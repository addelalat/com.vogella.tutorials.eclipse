== Compound custom widgets

The easiest way to create a custom SWT widget is to use a Composite, which contains other widgets.
This may look like that:

[source,java]
----
include::res/LabeledTextWidget.java[]
----


[WARNING]
====
Make sure that you pass `this` to the child widgets of your compound
custom widget. It is a common mistake that the <property>parent</property>
`Composite`, which is passed to the constructor of the custom widget, is
also used for the children.
