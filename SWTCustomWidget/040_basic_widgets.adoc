== Custom basic widgets

Sometimes you have special requirements for a custom widget, which cannot be delivered by an existing widget or a compound one, so that you must draw it yourself. 
As noted above we use `Canvas` for self drawn widgets, which do not have children.

=== Add a PaintListener and use redraw

Use the `addPaintListner` method in order to draw on a `Canvas` or `Composite` and use the`redraw` method instead of directly calling your internal paint methods, so that the framework may queue all redraw requests
and do them all at once.

The result and also how to use the `PaintListenerCanvas` sample below is shown in the screenshot:

=== SWT events and listener

In most cases the user will also interact with your custom widget. 
Therefore it must fire events like other widgets also do, i.e., a Button, which fires a `widgetSelected` event to it's attached `SelectionListener`.
You can invent new events and listeners in special cases. 
But in most of the cases it is sufficient to reuse existing SWT events and listeners. 
Imagine a custom drawn button, which obviously should reuse a default `SelectionListener`.
In case you reuse such an existing SWT event, you should either support TypedListener and also use SWT's low level `Listener` API, which can be applied to every widget by using the `addListener(int, Listener)` method.
For custom drawn widgets you likely want to add custom event listeners, which suit to
the widget's special purposes.
Say we got a custom Gameboy widget, where we want to be able to listen to the clicks
on the Gameboy's buttons.
The first thing to do is to define a custom event, which is derived from `java.util.EventObject`.

[source,java]

include::res/GameboySelectionEvent.java[]

With this event implementation we provide the event information, which button has been
selected.
Normally you just define a getter for specific event information and just pass the
values to the constructor of the custom event.
The next thing to do is to provide a listener interface to which the event is passed
in case a certain event occurs.

The last thing to do is simply offering an API to add and remove your custom listener
and to fire your custom events, which will be passed to the listener.
	
=== Positions in custom drawings

In custom drawings the positions of the elements inside it should be stored. 
So the positions of certain elements inside the custom widget can be found after they are drawn.
This is especially important, if elements of the drawing should trigger certain events.
Now that we know how to draw a custom widget with a `PaintListener` and defined our listener interfaces and events, we need to figure out when those events should be fired.
Therefore we need to track the positions of our custom drawings on the widget.
In order to do such a tracking we implement a `HoverCheck` class, which will enable us to recognize whenever a certain part of a widget is hovered.

[source,java]
----
include::res/HoverCheck.java[]
----

Inside this class we pass the widget itself, the x, y coordinates and the size of the part, where hovering should be checked. 
With this information we are able to create a 	`Rectangle`, which represents the position and size of this special part (i.e. a Gameboy button) and can use the Rectangle's `contains` method in
order to check, if the current mouse position is within this Rectangle or not.
In the GameboyWidget itself, we can use this HoverCheck class to figure out, if a certain button on the Gameboy was selected.
