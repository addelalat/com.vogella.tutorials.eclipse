== Using custom Regions for Widgets

Nowadays users often want some eye candy, e.g., having some nice shapes for certain shells.

In order to apply a custom shape for a `Control` the `Region` class can be used.

=== Regions are Resources

A `Region` is derived from `org.eclipse.swt.graphics.Resource`, which means that it *is necessary* to dispose them, once they are not needed any more.

[source, java]
----
Region region = new Region();

// apply region shape

control.setRegion(region);

region.dispose();

----

=== Specifying a Region for a Control

The `Control` class offers a `setRegion` method, where a `Region` can be applied.

The most important methods of a `Region` are `add`, `intersect` and `subtract` where the shape can be defined by either a rectangle or an array of points.

Here is an example where the Shell gets a shape of a crown:

[source, java]
----
include::res/CrownRegion.java[]
----

NOTE: The  x and y coordinates  of the `Region` are relative to the Control´s position and not relative to the display like the shell. That´s why the region rectangle (`region.add(0, 0, 300, 150);`) starts at 0, 0.

=== Adding controls to a "regionized" Shell

When adding controls to a shell, which has an applied `Region`, the area, which is not part of the region, should be considered.

For example by simply adding a `Button` it usually won´t show up, because it would be rendered in the area between the spikes of the crown.

Therefore the layout data, e.g. `GridData`, can be used to specify an indent for the `Control`.

[source, java]
----
include::res/CrownRegionWithButton.java[]
----

In this case an indent is added to the `GridData` of the `Button`.

The result should look similar to this:

=== Examples from SWT Snippets

The SWT snippets are always a nice source for more advanced examples like Snippet 134:

include::res/Snippet134.java[]
----

And as mentioned before the `setRegion` method belongs to the `Control` class, which means that a `Region` can also be applied for other `Controls` like a `Button`:

----
include::res/Snippet294.java[]
